Currently, Python’s presence within secondary and post-secondary schools varies greatly between different institutions, but the continuity in the lack of interdisciplinary coursework is a key limiting factor in the widespread growth of computing education. This is due to a variety of factors, including stereotypes and policy issues, but the bottom line is that Python being restricted to only computing classes restricts career opportunities and misrepresents the professional world. With support from a case-study of college-level physics students exposed to scientific programming, we propose novel methods of integrating Python into traditional coursework during this talk. The overarching mission of this discussion is to demonstrate how Python literacy in non-computing coursework can ultimately help in streamlining processes and accelerating progress in various industries. Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about the exciting prospect of expanding Python beyond the confines of computer science, and will have an exclusive look at a case-study that offers insight into student benefits of integrated coursework: as concerned stakeholders, it is ultimately well-informed Python community members who must unite to make a positive impact on the education system.","day":"2022-07-14","time":715,"endTime":745,"audience":"intermediate","rooms":["Liffey B"],"slug":"revolutionizing-education-how-python-is-essential-beyond-computer-science","type":"talk","speakers":[{"code":"9WBNHR","name":"Srivatsa Kundurthy","biography":"Srivatsa Kundurthy is a student based in the Greater New York City Area.

For instance, to the best of our knowledge, there is no general static analysis framework proposed to facilitate the implementation of dedicated Python static analyzers (e.g., compared to the Java Soot/WALA framework). \r\n\r\nEasy to use and fast to prototyping, what makes Python stand out is bringing challenges to static analysis tasks. To fill this gap, we design and implement [Scalpel](https://github.com/SMAT-Lab/Scalpel) (A Python Static Analysis Framework) and make it publicly available as an open-source project. The Scalpel framework has already integrated a number of fundamental static analysis functions (e.g., call graph constructions, control-flow graph constructions, alias analysis, etc.) that are ready to be reused by developers to implement client applications focusing on statically resolving dedicated Python problems such as detecting bugs or fixing vulnerabilities. In addition, documentation and the user guide are provided for users. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the Scalpel framework is to (1) improve Python software quality and (2) support addressing  research challenges (e.g. API studies) in software engineering research;","day":"2022-07-14","time":930,"endTime":960,"audience":"intermediate","rooms":["The Auditorium"],"slug":"scalpel-the-python-static-analysis-framework","type":"talk","speakers":[{"code":"RBJNZT","name":"Jiawei Wang","biography":"Jiawei Wang is a Ph.D. student at Monash University and a member of [SMart software Analysis and Trustworthy computing Lab](https://smat-lab.github.io/).
