In my own adventures living in Zimbabwe, I’ve always encountered ibises (the bird versions) perched on top of elephants. If you’ve never seen an elephant in real life I can confirm that they are huge, complex creatures. The image of a small bird sitting on top of a large elephant serves as a metaphor for how ibis (the package) provides a less complex, more performant way for Pythonistas to interact with multiple big data engines. \r\n\r\nI'll use the metaphor of elephants and ibises to show how this package can make a data workflow more Pythonic. The Zen of Python lets us know that simple is better than complex. The bigger and more complex your data, the more of an argument there is to use Ibis. Raw SQL can be quite difficult to maintain when your queries are very complex. For Python programmers, Ibis offers a way to write SQL in Python that allows for unit-testing, composability, and abstraction over specific query engines (e.g.BigQuery)! You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable.","day":"2022-07-13","time":645,"endTime":690,"audience":"intermediate","rooms":["Liffey Hall 1"],"slug":"elephants-ibises-and-a-more-pythonic-way-to-work-with-databases","type":"talk","speakers":[{"code":"7NWTAL","name":"Marlene Mhangami","biography":"Marlene is a Zimbabwean software engineer, explorer, and speaker based in the city of Harare.

We were able to fight through text files, user inputs, and geodata of all sorts and say goodbye to manual processing thanks to Python and its geospatial and data processing libraries. On the technical side, the presentation should introduce some of the handy geospatial and data processing tools to get your hands on any task, from producing colorful maps to analyzing time trends in satellite imagery.

The cells packages it creates are designed to be easily run with the open source EModelRunner package. The BluePyEModel software creates and optimizes in-silico neurons and is able to reproduce features from real neuronal experiment recordings.

Because of the duplicated parts in your code, you noticed that the code didn't conform to the DRY (_Don't Repeat Yourself_) principle.

Subsequently you will learn how you can combine this generator function with distinct hand-crafted functions or building blocks from the standard library `itertools` module or the `more-itertools` package.\r\n\r\nAs an example, imagine you'd need to implement some varying functionality based on the Fibonacci sequence.

The end result is that current FaaS platforms are much less efficient than they could be.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce a radically novel way to build FaaS platforms based on Python and the Unikraft Linux Foundation open source project (www.unikraft.org). Unikraft is a toolkit for building fully specialized, cloud-ready virtual machines called unikernels targeting a single application . Using Unikraft we can construct extremely specialized, Python-based unikernels that use only a few MBs to run a boot in 10s of milliseconds, allowing us to bring VMs up as a request to a function comes in, and to shut it down (or suspend it) afterwards. The result: a Python-based FaaS platform that is significantly more efficient and cheaper to operate than existing offerings.\r\n\r\nIn the talk we will provide an introduction to Unikraft, how Python is built on top of it, a full description of the FaaS platform and a short demo.","day":"2022-07-13","time":965,"endTime":995,"audience":"intermediate","rooms":["Liffey Hall 1"],"slug":"building-a-just-in-time-python-faas-platform-with-unikraft","type":"talk","speakers":[{"code":"GXDRHH","name":"Felipe Huici","biography":"Dr. Felipe Huici is CEO and Co-Founder at Unikraft UG, a start-up dedicated to lightweight and open source virtualization technologies and significantly lowering cloud infrastructure bills.
