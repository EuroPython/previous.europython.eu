“CCD” or the “Venue”</strong>) in Dublin, Ireland. For the “<strong>Online Event</strong>”, a
combination of tools used for the online Conference defined as “<strong>Online
Platform</strong>”.</p></article><article class="accent-right"><h2 id="1-registration"><a href="#1-registration">1. Registration</a></h2><p>Registration for participation in the conference must be made via the Event
Website. After purchase, the participant will receive an email from the
Organizers as a confirmation of the acceptance of the purchase contract.</p><p>Each ticket is bound to a named participant which can be set after purchase.
They can be reassigned, but only the person identified on the ticket is allowed
to use the ticket (the “Participant”). This includes any URLs, passwords sent
out to the Participant, which allow access to online media used during the
Event.</p><p>Tickets may be subject to proper proof of eligibility (e.g. student ID or
certificate). The Participants may be requested for such proof when picking up
the ticket at the conference registration desk or by the Organizers at any point
during the Event. If eligibility cannot be proven, the ticket can be converted
into a standard ticket or refunded.</p><p>Some ticket categories only have a limited number of available tickets. The
number of tickets is determined by the Organizers at their sole discretion.</p><p>For in-person events, the tickets can be picked up as badges at the conference
registration desk on the first day of the Event. The badge permits access to the
conference venue during the Event Days, subject to the ticket category.</p><p>For an online event, the confirmation email represents the ticket. It is also
listed in the Participant’s account on the Event Website. The Participant will
be granted access to the online media used during the online event either
directly by logging in to the Event Website on the Event Days or indirectly via
URLs sent to the registered email address, subject to the ticket category.</p></article><article class="accent-left"><h2 id="2-payments"><a href="#2-payments">2. Payments</a></h2><p>Unless otherwise stated, all prices include the currently applicable VAT rates
as required by local and EU regulations.</p><p>Invoices can be downloaded on the Event Website by logging into the account
which was used for the purchase. Invoices will be made available as soon as all
relevant local registrations have gone into effect, in particular the
registration for a local VAT ID.</p><p>Payments on the Event Website can only be made by debit or credit card. Other
forms of payment are not possible.</p><p>For debit or credit card payments, the cards will be charged immediately
following the application. Debit and credit card payments are handled by the
service provider Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com/">https://stripe.com/</a>). The Organizers do not store any
card information.</p></article><article class="accent-right"><h2 id="3-performance-and-cancellation"><a href="#3-performance-and-cancellation">3. Performance and Cancellation</a></h2><p>Admission to the Event is granted based on tickets (“Event Tickets” or

admission of the Event (or part thereof) to the extent defined on the Event
Website for each ticket category. The same applies to any additional items which
may be sold via the Event Website, such as e.g. SIM cards, tickets for museums,
local transport, etc.</p><p>Changes to the program, the event content, schedule and the speakers may occur
due to organizational reasons and are not considered as a breach of the purchase
contract. There is no right to refunds for any unused services which were
properly offered.</p><p>The Organizers are entitled to withdraw from the contract if carrying out the
Event would be uneconomic (e.g. due to insufficient number of exhibitors,
sponsors or participants). The same applies if the Event is canceled, in whole
or in part, for reasons beyond their reasonable control, such as act of God,
labor disputes, civil commotion, pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, vandalism,
war, lack of power or utilities, floods, fire, acts of Government or regulatory
authorities or other events of such effect that carrying out or the continuation
of the event would be unreasonable in the circumstances. The Organizers are
under no obligation to reorganize the event.</p><p>In case of a cancellation of the Event, all participants will be notified by the
Organizers without delay and any payments made will be refunded. The Organizers’
liability is limited to refund of the participation fee. All other liability for
participant claims is excluded except in cases of intent or gross negligence on
the part of the Organizers. In particular, no claims may be made for refund of
travel and accommodation costs, loss of working time or opportunity.</p></article><article class="accent-left"><h2 id="4-refunds"><a href="#4-refunds">4. Refunds</a></h2><p>The Event Tickets are fully refundable without stating a reason until <strong>June

payment card which was used for the purchase of the tickets.</p><p>Processing of the refunds will happen no later than 30 days after the end of the
Event.</p><p>Alternatively, the ticket may be reassigned to another participant at no extra
cost. Where eligibility constraints apply (e.g. students), the substitute
participant must similarly provide the required proper proof of eligibility. If
proof is not sufficiently provided, the substitute participant must pay the
difference between the discounted ticket and the standard ticket price.</p><h3 id="revocation-rights"><a href="#revocation-rights">Revocation Rights</a></h3><p>Conference tickets are not subject to the
