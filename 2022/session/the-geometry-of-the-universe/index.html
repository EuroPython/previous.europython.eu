Cheuk maintains its Python client and engages with its user community daily.\r\n\r\nBesides her work, Cheuk enjoys talking about Python on personal streaming platforms and podcasts. Cheuk has also been a speaker at Universities and various conferences. Besides speaking at conferences, Cheuk also organises events for developers. Conferences that Cheuk has organized include EuroPython (which she is a board member of), PyData Global and Pyjamas Conf. Believing in Tech Diversity and Inclusion, Cheuk constantly organizes workshops and mentored sprints for minority groups.

Cheuk will review why Pandas is useful to work with data and what advantage it has over the alternatives methods. As Pandas has many functionalities, Cheuk will dissect the discussion on the potential usage of Pandas in day-to-day data science workflow: data inspection, data cleaning, feature engineering etc.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the advantage of using Pandas, Cheuk will discuss the flip side. What makes Pandas a difficult tool to use at first. Here Cheuk will share how she used it efficiently with new users and some fundamental concepts about Pandas.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for Pandas users (new and old) or potential users. Those who are familiar with Pandas may get a refreshing idea from a new angle about the tool. And for the new users, it will be a good startup guide to make the journey of using it a bit easier.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-13T14:00:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T14:30:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["DSCHNK","L7PFLV","LTMDS9","NVKPEJ","Q3FPVG","X3CQ77"],"talks_after":["7DJJMK","AKJCWL","BL9NGV","DZZ8X9","P3EYQE"],"next_talk_code":"DZZ8X9","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/i-have-to-confess-i-still-love-pandas"},{"code":"L7PFLV","title":"Protocols in Python: Why You Need Them","speakers":[{"code":"CSV3TP","name":"Rogier van der Geer","biography":"Before joining GoDataDriven, Rogier obtained a PhD in particle physics.
