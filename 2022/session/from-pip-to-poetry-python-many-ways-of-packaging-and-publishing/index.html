Yet… the client has lost his interest: maybe right now he says that he has already come up with his own temporary solution and he has no intention to switch to another one?  Building internal products differs from commercial ones - there is no flow of cash and your clients are fully transparent.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I would like to share with you my experience and tips connected with developing such internal tools and standards.

I joined a team focused on drought research at the Czech Academy of Science in 2016 with a fresh degree in Geoinformatics and minimal experience with coding. Thanks to this very little initial knowledge, we were able to build a robust system providing drought monitoring and forecast for Czechia and also the whole of central Europe. We were able to fight through text files, user inputs, and geodata of all sorts and say goodbye to manual processing thanks to Python and its geospatial and data processing libraries. On the technical side, the presentation should introduce some of the handy geospatial and data processing tools to get your hands on any task, from producing colorful maps to analyzing time trends in satellite imagery.

Somebody has to review commits, write a change-log, add a version number, and publish to PyPI. There’s a better way: automatically publishing new packages merely by merging pull requests.","description":"Empowering anyone to issue a new release by submitting a pull request? At first glance, it seems like an outlandish idea. Upon further inspection, however, the benefits become clear.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest sources of friction in software development is packaging and publishing new releases. Somebody has to sift through the commits and write a change-log, tag it with a new version number, and publish the package to PyPI. And usually only one or two people have the access necessary for this last step.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate result is an infrequent release cadence. Bug fixes and new features are sitting there in the `main` branch, but hardly anybody is benefiting from them because they aren’t in a shipped release yet.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there’s a better way: a continuous release process where new versions are auto-published via pull requests — without any manual monkeying.\r\n\r\nIn this environment, all pull requests must include a release file that describes the changes within. This file must also include whether the new version should be a major, minor, or patch release.\r\n\r\nThe continuous integration (CI) process looks for this file, and if one hasn’t been included, the tests will fail, and the pull request won’t be merged. Otherwise, a maintainer merges the pull request, and the CI process then uses the release file to put the description into the change-log, increment the version number, commit, tag, build, and publish the new release to PyPI.\r\n\r\nSo with almost no human input, every code contribution results in a new release in a matter of minutes. Every feature and bug-fix has its own release, without anyone having to remember to package and publish a new version. Plus, if a bug is found, it’s now much easier to trace it to a specific release version.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best part is that all contributors get to issue their own releases. What better way to welcome new contributors than to reward them with a dedicated release composed entirely of their own work?\r\n\r\nAttendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and skills:\r\n\r\n* what kinds of problems are introduced by an infrequent release cadence\r\n* how automated releases solve those problems and provide myriad ancillary benefits\r\n* how to format and parse the release file\r\n* how to use continuous integration (CI) systems to automate releases\r\n* how to add deployment code so new versions are released when PRs are merged\r\n* how to use [AutoPub](https://github.com/autopub/autopub) to facilitate this process","duration":"30","python_level":"none","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"The Auditorium","start":"2022-07-13T11:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T12:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["DYDA3H","G7MNXY","KMCFKN","STQEKX","ZYAD7Z"],"talks_after":["8KEVYF","9LFFBL","E7CX9K","N3HJ87","NUF3K9","QQJFSS","YYQBM3"],"next_talk_code":"E7CX9K","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/python-packaging-automation-auto-publish-to-pypi-via-pull-requests"},{"code":"STQEKX","title":"Using python to predict Asset price reversals.","speakers":[{"code":"K379P3","name":"Niall O'Connor","biography":"Niall started coding on a sord m5 in 1984, love coding.
