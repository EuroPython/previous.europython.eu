This project consists of a set of experiments on similar data-sets from news\r\nagencies across the various subsets in the ”media-bias” chart. News Media perceived bias\r\nis common across consumers that belong to various political affiliations. While anecdotal\r\nevidence of this exists and there exist annotated datasets that aim to annotate the ”spin”\r\na news agency puts on certain events and entities, whether this is a widespread problem\r\nand whether it can be detected by the neural network topically or temporally is a problem that needs to be explored. The news media bias analysis is modelled as a Natural\r\nLanguage Processing sentiment analysis task and a fake news binary classification task to\r\ndeduce the level of polarization in a neural network by feeding it headlines embedded using\r\npre-trained sentiment models from news publications across the political spectrum. When\r\nit came to fake news vulnerability, news from all kinds of perceived politically affiliated\r\nnews media holds up well against a fake news dataset with a very good accuracy. None of\r\nthe accuracies dropped below 95%. This is a significant result that sort of debunks the AllSlides categorization","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Is news media polarization based in fact or is it conditioned due to the consumption of alternative news media?","description":"This work is an example of an intersection of a non\r\nscientific field with computer science and mathematics, trying to quantify, measure and identify\r\nnon mathematical phenomena in the language of mathematics. It is important because it could\r\nbe the basis of the scientific approaches that the next generation policy makers, voters, non\r\nprofit social organizations and governments could use to make life changing decisions for their\r\ncitizens.\r\n2\r\nThe questions that this study tries to answer is whether a neural network can learn biases from\r\nthe news media based on perceived bias scores obtained from independent agencies. It also\r\nseeks to answer whether any of these political leanings of the news media affect the vulnerability of their consumer when it comes to fake news. The results of this experiment aim to show\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n1. SVMs perform better clustering with respect to the categories than neural networks, however the maximum does not cross 67%\r\n2. The most significant conclusion from this work is that though there is a perceived bias\r\nwhen it comes to news agencies, when looked at from a neural networks standpoint, it\r\nis negligible. Mainstream news agencies are not able to polarize a neural network with\r\ninherent biases in their headlines.\r\n3. There may be topical biases that need to be examined by using an Entity linking and bias\r\ncalculation approach\r\n4.

However, even they posit some bottlenecks either due to their synchronous nature or due to the usage of python runtime. Most of them don’t have the ability to speed themselves due to their dependence on *SGIs. This is where Robyn comes in. Robyn tries to achieve near-native Rust throughput along with the benefit of writing code in Python. In this talk, we will learn more about Robyn. From what is Robyn to the development in Robyn.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Robyn: A Python Web Framework with a runtime written in Rust","description":"With the effort put in at every Python version to increase the runtime performance, we know that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the Python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nInspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web ecosystem and the increased focus on performance, Robyn was born. \r\n\r\nRobyn is one of the fastest, if not the fastest Python web framework in the current Python web ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn tries to achieve near-native rust performance while still having the ease of writing Python code. \r\n\r\nThis talk will demonstrate the reasons why Robyn was created, the technical decisions behind Robyn, the increased performance by using the rust runtime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly, how the community is helping Robyn grow!\r\nFinally, I will be sharing the future plans of Robyn and would love to get feedback from the developers to see what they would like to see in it.","duration":"30","python_level":"expert","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Wicklow Hall 1","start":"2022-07-14T15:30:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T16:00:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["3HCYQ9","7FNTEJ","JWUZ7E","LCNBCC","NF9HFT"],"talks_after":["9VWGLC","BNJPUH","JJQSXA","NL8HRY","QMZDVX","ZSCTME"],"next_talk_code":"JJQSXA","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/robyn-an-async-python-web-framework-with-a-rust-runtime"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"memory-problems-did-collector-forgot-to-clean-the-garbage"},"buildId":"TLlzm4r8yGVCzFtabSCgh","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
