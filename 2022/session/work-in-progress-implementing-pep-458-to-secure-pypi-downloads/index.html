To do that we created extendable Python-based framework that allowed us to easily plug-in different Machine Translation engines and compare them across large variety of test datasets with a unified set of quality metrics. Our goal from the start was to create universal MT evaluation framework, that will be useful not only for healthcare domain, but to a wider community as well.\r\n\r\nAt this talk we will present our evaluation framework an will do a walk-through of its capabilities. We also cover how it can be extended to new MT engines, new test datasets and new language pairs. We will also present our evaluation results for several state-of-the-art machine translation engines, both open-source and cloud-based.\r\n\r\nAll the source code of our framework is published to open source:\r\nhttps://github.com/Optum/nmt","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Python-based universal evalaution framework for Machine Translation engines","description":"Task of Machine Translation engine evaluation may be very challenging. Quality of Machine Translation varies greatly depending on domain and language pair. Different MT engines may have different interfaces or APIs and different requirements to run. To add to that, even definition of a good translation may be debatable, with any automatic MT quality metric providing only approximation of actual translation quality. That's why having universal evaluation framework for this task is very important. In our work we tried to create such framework.\r\n\r\n1) We defined base translation class that unified all file handling, batch creation and result processing. As a result of that, only work needed to support new MT engine was creation of small child class that implemented couple of simple functions. That allows us to easily extend our framework to MT engines and new language pairs.\r\n\r\n2) We defined set of test datasets and provided a way to add new datasets to this set. For our evaluation our aim was to create test data that covers both general and healthcare domains  EMEA dataset (https://opus.nlpl.eu/EMEA.php), OPUS-100 (https://opus.nlpl.eu/opus-100.php), Paracrawl (https://paracrawl.eu/) and several others. But our data preparations scripts can be easily extended to other domains and datasets as well.\r\n\r\n3) We defined a set of quality metrics to evaluate results of MT engines. Metrics that we used included BLEU (https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu), BERTScore (https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score), ROUGE (https://github.com/pltrdy/rouge), TER and CHRF (both also from sacrebleu implementation).\r\n\r\nBeside MT evaluation framework we will present our own evaluation results. For our evaluation we used cloud based engines - Azure Translator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/), Google Translate (https://cloud.google.com/translate/), as well as open-source engines - Marian MT (https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/marian.html), NVIDIA's NeMo (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/machine_translation.html), Facebook's MBart 50 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-one-to-many-mmt), Facebook's M2M100 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_418M). For open source engines we tried to use Huggingface's transformer implementation whenever possible. But as we mentioned our framework was designed in a way to be easily extendable to other MT engines and underlying frameworks.\r\n\r\nWe also will present evaluation results for NeMo and MarianMT engines that we fine-tuned specifically for healthcare domain. While these particular results may rather specific to our use case, they help to highlight how our framework can be extended to custom MT engines as well.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-15T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T12:25:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["GFGSGN","LLC3KD","MBJUKF","MMWYWZ","PQADBJ","TE7K7D"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"S78FW7","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/machine-translation-engines-evaluation-framework"},{"code":"LLC3KD","title":"Game Development with CircuitPython","speakers":[{"code":"CSLXTY","name":"Radomir Dopieralski","biography":"A Python programmer by day, an electronics hobbyist by night.

Beynon, Alun Owens, Andrew J. Logsdail\r\nCardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales.\r\n\r\nComputational methods afford an insight into the behaviours and properties of materials and recently Python packages have increasingly become a powerful tool for the study of chemical systems. Computational chemistry is the branch of chemistry that studies chemical systems through simulation and involves HPC architecture and software packages. In general, there are two categories of simulation, dynamic and static and of these types, atoms in the system may be described by varying levels of theory: molecular (classical) mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) or a combination of the two (QM/MM). Static calculations obtain the property of the system at a fixed geometry, whereas dynamic calculations study the evolution of a system over a given timeframe. \r\n\r\nPython has become an integral part of computational modelling of materials in recent years, with development of packages such as the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [1], which is a set of modules for manipulating, running and visualising atomic simulation. Furthermore, ASE integrates seamlessly with many electronic structure software packages, used for calculating the energy and properties of systems based on some level of theory, e.g Density Functional Theory (DFT), such as FHI-aims and VASP. [2,3] Moreover, the combination with other Python packages that integrate with ASE provide an ecosystem for atomic simulations (figure 1). Packages such as CatLearn, [4] a machine-learning approach used for determining transition states and energies needed for reactions, along with Phonopy and FHI-vibes, [5,6] both are for studying lattice dynamics of materials, and Py-ChemShell,[7] used for QM/MM calculations, to name a few, provide a comprehensive toolkit for the computational study of materials and chemical systems. \r\n\r\nIn our research, such approaches as outlined above are essential to further our understanding of materials and chemical processes, and of particular interest are materials for green and sustainable processes such as catalysts used for biofuel production, and battery materials, namely, zeolite Tin-BETA and Prussian Blue, [8-10] respectively. In collaboration with experimentalists, we seek to understand the synthetic methods and properties of these materials, with the aim to further establish them as viable alternatives to fossil fuels. In this regard, as Python software becomes increasingly popular for the simulation and study of materials, it also provides the tools and methods needed for tackling some of the grand challenges of today. \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n[1] A.
