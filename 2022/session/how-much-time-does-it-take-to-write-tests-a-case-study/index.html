Today's musicians use DAWs as instruments in themselves. But what if you want to combine the power of a DAW with the flexibility of writing your own code?\r\n\r\nPedalboard was built to fill this niche: to pull the power of a DAW into your Python code.

Or, in an attempt to factor out these common parts, you ended up with a loop construct containing a lot of conditional code for varying start, stop, or selection criteria?\r\n\r\nYou might have felt that the end result just didn't look right. Because of the duplicated parts in your code, you noticed that the code didn't conform to the DRY (_Don't Repeat Yourself_) principle. Or, after an attempt to combine the variations into a single loop, with consequently a lot of conditional code, your inner voice told you that the resulting code had become too complex and difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show you a way out of this situation. It demonstrates how you can create a **generator function** that implements only the common parts of your loop construct. Subsequently you will learn how you can combine this generator function with distinct hand-crafted functions or building blocks from the standard library `itertools` module or the `more-itertools` package.\r\n\r\nAs an example, imagine you'd need to implement some varying functionality based on the Fibonacci sequence. This talk shows you how it would look like before and after you've refactored it into a **pipeline of generators**.\r\n\r\nAfter having seen this pattern, you will recognize more quickly when this kind of refactoring helps you to create more maintainable and more Pythonic code.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Have you ever found yourself coding variations of a loop construct without knowing how to cleanly factor out the common parts?

To provide strong isolation, the functions are run inside heavy-weight virtual machines (and within containers inside those for orchestration reasons). Consequently, such instances take too long to boot and so are kept on all the time, even though the functions only receive requests intermittently. The end result is that current FaaS platforms are much less efficient than they could be.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce a radically novel way to build FaaS platforms based on Python and the Unikraft Linux Foundation open source project (www.unikraft.org). Unikraft is a toolkit for building fully specialized, cloud-ready virtual machines called unikernels targeting a single application . Using Unikraft we can construct extremely specialized, Python-based unikernels that use only a few MBs to run a boot in 10s of milliseconds, allowing us to bring VMs up as a request to a function comes in, and to shut it down (or suspend it) afterwards. The result: a Python-based FaaS platform that is significantly more efficient and cheaper to operate than existing offerings.\r\n\r\nIn the talk we will provide an introduction to Unikraft, how Python is built on top of it, a full description of the FaaS platform and a short demo.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Building an Extremely Efficient, Just-in-Time, Python FaaS Platform with Unikraft","description":"Unikraft [1] is a unikernel (specialized virtual machine) project. Unikraft is able to target a specific application (e.g., a web server such as NGINX) and transparently build an entire software stack, from the operating system all the way up to systems libraries, that includes only the parts that the application needs and nothing more. Such specialization results in extremely short boot times (a few milliseconds compared to hundreds or thousands for Linux VMs), small image sizes and memory consumption (e.g., a few MBs vs. hundreds of MBs) and a minimal attack surface, to name a few benefits. The short boot times also allow us to bring Unikraft VMs up just-in-time, as a request for a service arrives, and to bring the instance back down (or suspend it) when the request is over, allowing for even greater efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Unikraft images are single address space: in cloud environments strong isolation is provided by the hypervisor, so for single application/single tenant VMs it does not make sense to have a kernel/user-space divide. The end result is higher efficiency in performance, with Unikraft yielding noticeably higher throughout than Linux [2].\r\n\r\nRegarding application support, we have put great effort towards making Unikraft as POSIX compatible as possible. Unikraft provides a syscall shim-layer and support for the musl libc, allowing us to run unmodified versions of Python. \r\n\r\nIn terms of orchestration, we have integrated Unikraft with major frameworks such as Kubernetes and Prometheus. This, along with extensive debugging facilities should make Unikraft easy to both use and develop for.\r\n\r\n[1] https://unikraft.org/\r\n[2] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456248 (best paper award)","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-13T16:05:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T16:35:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["39YWUH","98XE8Q","HJWZ37","HWMZZG","VAGHFS"],"talks_after":["GN9FNF"],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"VFEVKR","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/building-a-just-in-time-python-faas-platform-with-unikraft"},{"code":"HWMZZG","title":"Music and Code","speakers":[{"code":"WADEN9","name":"Nicholas H.Tollervey","biography":"A recovering former member of the Python community.\r\n\r\nMusic, philosophy, teaching, writing \u0026 computing.
