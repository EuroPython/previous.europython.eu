All you know is that one of your endpoints or applications is too slow; and perhaps it only affects a certain user or customer. How do you figure out why it's slow, and what can you do to catch performance problems before they hurt users in production?\r\n\r\nWe'll go through a wide range of strategies for detecting and diagnosing performance problems in typical production workloads. We'll cover both web-based domains as well as backend domains and other analytical applications involving number-crunching and big-data applications.\r\n\r\nWe'll step through the following high-level strategies:\r\n\r\n- Tracing: through instrumentation of your code, you will get detailed traces of where the time is spent in generating your web server responses.\r\n- Profiling: we'll look at profiling strategies using both the Python built-in cProfile tool, as well as awesome 3rd party libraries like pyspy, including how to use these with pytest\r\n- Isolation: how to figure out if performance is affected by CPU, or memory, disk, or network IO limitations.\r\n- Reasoning: we'll look at common scenarios that result in performance regressions such as the needless execution of sub-queries in rendering web views, or algorithmic analysis and \"big-O\" notation, or concurrency problems resulting from exhaustion of threads in a pool and asyncio concurrency limitations resulting from overloaded subscription.\r\n- Prophylaxis: we'll look at how to include benchmarks within your CI pipeline, including with pytest and other technologies to catch performance regressions ahead of time.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-15T11:20:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T11:50:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["CJNVSR","GRG9SC","S78FW7","YJYBHC","ZGSULC"],"talks_after":["GFGSGN","HE98XH","LLC3KD","MBJUKF","MMWYWZ","PQADBJ","TE7K7D"],"next_talk_code":"TE7K7D","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/why-is-it-slow-strategies-for-solving-performance-problems"},{"code":"CJNVSR","title":"Mercury - Build \u0026 Share Data Apps from Jupyter Notebook","speakers":[{"code":"JWK7RV","name":"Piotr Płoński","biography":"Software engineer with a passion for creating Data Science tools.

The overall system is represented as a collection of models that exchange data.

In this contribution, we present a model query mechanism allowing notebook models to query one another. The model dependencies are represented with a graph with suitable processing algorithms. In order to ensure that only affected models are executed we derive and cache a model resolution order.

On one side of the “openness” spectrum some projects are out there to give a bit of visibility to what a team is doing or to showcase a research or another product, and on the other spectrum the creators of a project put it out there to create a user and contributing community so that eventually the community would be active enough for the original creators to become a minority in the contributing and governance team.

Yet when you run a notebook, there's a lot that's happening under the hood - from starting a session with the notebook server, to launching an IPython kernel, and a rich Web UI communicating with the notebook server and the IPython kernel using Jupyter's REST APIs and ZMQ websockets. We will explore the Jupyter ecosystem and see how this system comes together. \r\n\r\nThe architecture of all the offerings in the Jupyter Project (such as the classic Jupyter Notebook), the newer JupyterLab IDE, or the scalable multi-user environment - JupyterHub is completely distributed.\r\nAt their core, there's a front end client like a web browser or a qt console that talks to the Notebook server using its many APIs (like the kernel API) and to the language kernel (in our case IPython) using ZMQ Sockets, allowing the Jupyter architecture to scale easily. \r\nIn this presentation, we look closely at these REST API calls, and the ZMQ socket traffic using simple tools like the browser's network tab. We will also try to manipulate a notebook using simple code to get a full appreciation of these internals.","duration":"45","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 2","start":"2022-07-15T10:30:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T11:15:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8JDRVD","9QM8ZM","CPNE9S","FZQGFP","USWAD9"],"talks_after":["87XUMG","CJNVSR","GRG9SC","S78FW7","YJYBHC","ZGSULC"],"next_talk_code":"CJNVSR","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/jupyter-under-the-hood"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"what-transitioning-from-male-to-female-taught-me-about-leadership"},"buildId":"0ezuoYF1Bh36D37zGfmfs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
