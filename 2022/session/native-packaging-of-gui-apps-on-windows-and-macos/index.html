However, students and researchers working in these disciplines lack the necessary programming proficiency and coding experience . The need then arises to make Python-based computational methods accessible – we present case-studies of how to do this via various Python modules being taught at College of Business in Technological University Dublin and by means of walkthrough of an interdisciplinary social good project called InEire. It comes down to complementing existing quantitative and qualitative methods with methods based on analysis of various types of data specific to the social science problem being solved. We essentially go through the process of building curiosity-driven exploration in social science students via a theoretically driven research question rather than the Python technique itself, and then focusing on the various steps involved in solving that question; and finally boiling it down to a concrete Python-based data analytics methodology. This project-based teaching methodology helped us develop Python skills in newbies eventually leading to a Python-based data analytic skills in students of disciplines other than Computer Science.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Join us for an interactive step-by-step approach to teaching Python for arts, humanities and social sciences in an attempt to bridge divide between data scientists and policymakers","description":"The various areas within humanities and social sciences such as political science, sociology, psychology, economics etc. have evolved to a point where they have been complementing existing qualitative and quantitative methods with methods rooted in data science. This shift in paradigm is primarily driven by real-world, publicly available data sets that cover a variety of scholarly domains and have the potential to solve fundamental research questions in these intriguing fields. There is however a huge bottleneck to be overcome before realizing the full potential of data science in arts, humanities and social sciences; and that bottleneck relates to a fear of programming in students/researchers within these disciplines. Our talk presents some tips and tricks from course modules being taught in Technological University Dublin; the fundamental idea is to present an overview of data science toolkit and how it relates to problem solving in the real world. \r\n\r\nFirst we will present ways to make the data science lifecycle being made easy via tools such as Google colab and Jupyter notebooks followed by explaining how showing students the big picture and the workflow lifecycle of a data science technique helps grasps concepts in a very effective manner. We will present examples from exploratory data analysis and classification using data-driven research questions; and look into elegant solutions that can easily be plugged into a social scientist’s skillset. Examples of continuous assessment projects based on different Python libraries are also presented with a view to further establish use of Python as a valuable tool for arts, humanities, and social sciences.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will give an overview of an Irish research council funded project emanating from a combination of STEM and HUMANIITIES disciplines that aims to perform an economic assessment of anti-immigrant sentiment in Ireland. Various phases of the project will be explained emphasizing particularly those where Python tools play a major role in interpretion of research outcomes. These research outcomes obtained through smart use of Python data analytic tools play a key role in building relationships between data scientists and policy makers in both government and not-for-profit sector.","duration":"30","python_level":"none","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-15T15:30:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T16:00:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["7UYS9V","BZL7YY","JBTGFL","TDUFJ9","WVFUYA"],"talks_after":["QPDML3"],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/python-for-arts-humanities-and-social-sciences"},{"code":"7UYS9V","title":"Demystifying Python’s Internals: Diving into CPython by implementing a pipe operator","speakers":[{"code":"UPWXFZ","name":"Sebastiaan Zeeff","biography":"Sebastiaan is a Software Engineer for the Ordina Pythoneers and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.

Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it’s often difficult to know where to start or what you’re missing.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will show you around the CPython source code by implementing a new operator, a pipe operator. While doing so, I will discuss core parts of the internals, such as Python’s grammar, its syntax trees, and the underlying logic that will perform the operation. By the end, you will have a good idea of the moving parts involved in core language features.\r\n\r\nI will also take you through the steps necessary to make it all work. I’ll show you how I obtained a copy of the source code, regenerated the parser and token files, and how I compiled my modified version of CPython. I will also write and run tests to help me implement my changes. This should give you a mental framework that helps you while diving into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).\r\n\r\nMy talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython’s internals.

It sometimes causes data scientists great headaches. But from a consumer and Pythonista point of view this can also be interesting data for exploration. It is very useful for building personalization technology, in particular recommender systems. And there are almost endless ways to use Python for it.\r\nSo, let’s request and use our own data to build a playlist recommender system which infers our music taste from our streaming history and uses it to retrieve songs from our favorites in a new way.

However, rediscovery seems to be limited on the more recent past, i.e. going only a month backwards.

However, you once explicitly declared those tracks as favorites. So, what is it that we can do about this missing piece in personalized playlist recommendations?\r\n\r\nWell, the first thing we do is to request our personal usage data from Spotify according to GDPR. Second, we analyze and enrich it with track audio features offered by Spotify’s rich Web API. We derive the music taste profile of ourselves from 12 months of streaming history and use this taste profile to retrieve favorite songs we haven’t listened to for more than a year.

The extra work needed to do the right thing competes with the almost overwhelming need for new development, and unclear code ownership and lack of insight into the size and scope of type problems add to the burden. We’ve greatly mitigated these problems by building an automated refactoring pipeline that applies Black formatting and backfills missing types via incremental Github pull requests. Our refactor applications use LibCST and MonkeyType to modify the Python syntax tree and use GitPython/PyGithub to create and manage pull requests. It divides changes into small, easily reviewed pull requests and assigns appropriate code owners to review them. After creating and merging more than 3,000 pull requests, we have fully converted our large codebase to Black format and have added type annotations to more than 50,000 functions. In this talk, you’ll learn to use LibCST to build automated refactoring tools that fix general Python code quality issues at scale and how to use GitPython/PyGithub to automate the code review process.\r\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/jimmy_lai/europython-2022-automated-refactoring-large-python-codebases","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Automated refactoring on large Python codebases for adopting Black formatting and type annotation with incremental changes by using open source LibCST, GitPython and PyGithub.","description":"","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-15T14:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T15:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["9PQZKF","BADDYW","GAVCZ8","PAXMHN"],"talks_after":["3ZGCQR","7UYS9V","BZL7YY","JBTGFL","TDUFJ9","WVFUYA"],"next_talk_code":"3ZGCQR","prev_talk_code":"9EH9PG","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/automated-refactoring-large-python-codebases"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"native-packaging-of-gui-apps-on-windows-and-macos"},"buildId":"0ezuoYF1Bh36D37zGfmfs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
