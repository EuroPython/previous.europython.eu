I am sorry, but they are not that ‚Äúmagic‚Äù!
I agree they are really cool, but dunder methods (the name they usually go by) are just regular Python methods that you implement!
And it is my job to help <strong>you</strong> learn about them.</p><p><strong>Dunder methods</strong> are the methods that you need to implement when you want your objects to interact with the syntax of Python.
Do you want <code>len</code> to be callable on your objects? Implement <code>__len__</code>.
Do you want your objects to be iterables? Implement <code>__iter__</code>.
Do you want arithmetics to work on your objects? Implement <code>__add__</code> (and a bunch of others!).
Just to name a few things your objects could be doing.</p><p>In this training, we will go over a series of small use cases for many of the existing dunder methods: we will learn about the way in which each dunder method is supposed to work and then we implement it.
This will make you a more well-rounded Python developer because you will have a greater appreciation for how things work in Python.
I will also show you the approaches I follow when I am learning about a new dunder method and trying to understand how it works, which will help you explore the remainder dunder methods by yourself.</p><p>For this training, you need Python 3.8+ and your code editor of choice.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mathspp/talks">Get the slides, exercises, and other resources on Github</a>.</p><p><span class="tag">Tutorial</span><span class="tag">(c)Python Internals</span></p></article><hr/><article class="accent-left"><h2 class="h5">The speaker</h2><div><p class="large"><a href="/speaker/rodrigo-girao-serrao" class="speaker-link">Rodrigo Gir√£o Serr√£o</a></p><p>Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming ‚Äì so that he could solve more problems.

Trans\\*Code participants from all backgrounds come together to spend a day working together to create prototypes around the themes of transgender issues and access to technology.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea, or want to work with others to learn about and improve the situation of the trans and non-binary communities through technology, please join us.","duration":"360","python_level":"none","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-12T09:30:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-12T11:00:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["3B9WHE","DHHVHZ","KP9CPX","LY3NUG","XK833K"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/trans-code"},{"code":"DHHVHZ","title":"Picking What to Watch Next - build a recommendation system","speakers":[{"code":"8EGVC9","name":"Cheuk Ting Ho","biography":"Before working in Developer Relations, Cheuk has been a Data Scientist in various companies which demands high numerical and programmatical skills, especially in Python.

The model will be KNN Item-Based, meaning based on show information, it suggests users who have watched X show a Y show which is similar to that one. While doing it, we will do data transformation with Pandas and Scipy, and train the model with Scikit-learn.\r\n\r\n**For whom is your Workshop**\r\nData Scientist or developers who have no experience in building a recommendation engine and is curious how it can be done. The model we built is in no way good enough to be deployed as a product but would be a very good first model to learn from and get the idea of how machine learning can be used in finding correlations between items.\r\n\r\n**Short Format of your Workshop**\r\nOverview-10 min, Lecture - 30 mins, Breaks - 20 minutes, Hands-on training - 120 mins, Closing - 10 mins\r\n\r\n**Workshop Agenda**\r\nOverview-10 min\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will go through the workshop structure, introduce the steps that we take and the tools that we will be using in the workshop.\r\n\r\nLecture - 30 mins\r\n\r\nIn this session, through slides and presentation, we will go through some knowledge about recommendation engines, what models are available in the market and how they work. We will discuss their advantages and disadvantages and the fundamental theories that work behind the scenes. This will include the model that we are going to build and the more complicated ones that are more commonly used in business.\r\n\r\nBreaks- 20 minutes\r\n\r\nA short break, overrun buffer, answering questions and setup for the hands-on training.\r\n\r\nHands-on training - 120 mins\r\n\r\nAt the start of this session, we will have a look at the project skeleton and look at the functions that we will implement in this workshop. (10 mins)\r\n\r\nThen we will work on the part that transforms the data into a format that is ready to be trained with the KNN model. (50mins)\r\n\r\nAfterwards, we will work on the part that train the KNN model. Here we will run some experiments and play with different parameters, for example, different similarity metrics, in training. (50 mins)\r\n\r\nFinally, we will test our recommender in the CLI. (10mins)\r\n\r\nBonus: we will test our recommender in the browser with PyScript\r\n\r\nClosing - 10 mins\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will wrap up what we learned and suggest further learning materials to those who may want to study further in this topic.\r\n\r\n**What is required from attendees**\r\nA computer with a stable internet connection; Python 3.9 or above and poetry installed; An opened mind and ready to learn something new\r\n\r\n**What Attendees will Learn**\r\nBy the end of the workshop, you will have built your first recommendation engine. You will be given enough information about how to build a better one and where to study further in you are inspired to be an expert in this field.\r\n\r\n**Course Benefits**\r\nYou will have learned a new skill set that may assist you in your next data science project.

Done right, they bridge the gap between those analyzing the data and those consuming the analysis. However, learning to create impactful, aesthetically-pleasing visualizations can often be challenging. This session will equip you with the skills to make customized visualizations for your data using Python.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many plotting libraries to choose from, the prolific Matplotlib library is always a great place to start. Since various Python data science libraries utilize Matplotlib under the hood, familiarity with Matplotlib itself gives you the flexibility to fine tune the resulting visualizations (e.g., add annotations, animate, etc.). This session will also introduce interactive visualizations using HoloViz, which provides a higher-level plotting API capable of using Matplotlib and Bokeh (a Python library for generating interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations) under the hood.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Join @StefanieMolin for her #dataviz in #Python workshop, which covers static, animated, \u0026 interactive visualizations with  @matplotlib  +  @HoloViews .","description":"#### Section 1: Getting Started With Matplotlib\r\nWe will begin by familiarizing ourselves with Matplotlib. Moving beyond the default options, we will explore how to customize various aspects of our visualizations. By the end of this section, you will be able to generate plots using the Matplotlib API directly, as well as customize the plots that libraries like pandas and Seaborn create for you.\r\n\r\n#### Section 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations\r\nStatic visualizations are limited in how much information they can show. To move beyond these limitations, we can create animated and/or interactive visualizations. Animations make it possible for our visualizations to tell a story through movement of the plot components (e.g., bars, points, lines). Interactivity makes it possible to explore the data visually by hiding and displaying information based on user interest. In this section, we will focus on creating animated visualizations using Matplotlib before moving on to create interactive visualizations in the next section.\r\n\r\n#### Section 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration\r\nWhen exploring our data, interactive visualizations can provide the most value. Without having to create multiple iterations of the same plot, we can use mouse actions (e.g., click, hover, zoom, etc.) to explore different aspects and subsets of the data. In this section, we will learn how to use a few of the libraries in the HoloViz ecosystem to create interactive visualizations for exploring our data utilizing the Bokeh backend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n####  Prerequisites\r\nThis workshop is for anyone with basic knowledge of Python and an interest in learning how to take their data visualization skills to the next level. We will be working with Jupyter Notebooks, so attendees should familiarize themselves with the interface (i.e., know how to run/edit a cell) beforehand.
