I joined a team focused on drought research at the Czech Academy of Science in 2016 with a fresh degree in Geoinformatics and minimal experience with coding. Thanks to this very little initial knowledge, we were able to build a robust system providing drought monitoring and forecast for Czechia and also the whole of central Europe. We were able to fight through text files, user inputs, and geodata of all sorts and say goodbye to manual processing thanks to Python and its geospatial and data processing libraries. On the technical side, the presentation should introduce some of the handy geospatial and data processing tools to get your hands on any task, from producing colorful maps to analyzing time trends in satellite imagery. It should also be a guide on identifying needs and building the most necessary data manipulation processes from scratch.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Python in Czech Drought Monitoring System for geospatial data processing and automatization of tasks in the scientific team.","description":"","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey B","start":"2022-07-13T12:10:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T12:40:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8KEVYF","E7CX9K","N3HJ87","NUF3K9","QQJFSS","YYQBM3"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"G7MNXY","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/czech-drought-monitoring-system-a-journey-from-manual-work-to-global-drought-monitoring-and-machine-learning-powered-by-python"},{"code":"N3HJ87","title":"Taking charge of your race conditions","speakers":[{"code":"MHFQEH","name":"Borjan Tchakaloff","biography":"Borjan has been fully focusing his attention on software engineering with Python for the last four years.

And do you have blocks of code that must not be called concurrently? Maybe you didn't even realise it until your system experienced a bug you could not reproduce until the stars aligned. Then you surely know that hope is not the answer to a robust system, we must be prepared to face worst-case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis talk will first briefly present race conditions, a staple in concurrent computing. We will then compare implicit and explicit concurrency management in your core logic, that is whether you delegate or craft protective logic yourself. Next comes testing, the real crux of the talk, where we will demonstrate how to manufacture a race condition. Finally we will explore how to solve such problems with the built-in tools the Python standard library offers.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Get a quick tour of race condition handling in Python: what it is, the built-in tools, and how to test for it.","description":"Anybody working with concurrency (threads, processes, or more abstractly workers) eventually encounters a _race condition_. This kind of hair-pulling problem is a staple in computer science. Sometimes you can offload the problem to a lower layer, usually to the database engine, bundling it with atomic transactions. But there are times when you have to take charge of worst-case concurrency scenarios, when your architecture and constraints do not leave room for implicit concurrency management. Then, you need to carefully craft the paths in and out of the critical section, avoiding deadlocks along the way.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will focus on how to test your program with a manufactured race condition. If you know it can happen, you'd better cover it in your test suite. We will define a server program called in parallel by multiple clients to illustrate the problem at hand. Then, we will manually set-up a race condition during testing to explore broken behaviour and problematic code.\r\n\r\nThe Python standard library offers all the tools we need to cater for race conditions. We hope the tour we will give allows you to exercise your own race conditions more easily.

In particular, this increase in computational power allows one to run previously-trained machine learning algorithms natively on an IoT device. \r\n\r\nThis presents an exciting opportunity: IoT devices often feature a variety of onboard sensors which can be used as inputs into a machine learning algorithm. \r\n\r\nThis talk will use the presenter's boxing training as a practical example of applying sensor data to a machine learning algorithm. In particular, this talk will demonstrate using motion sensor data obtained on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense configured with TensorFlow Lite.

The amount of data and code this implies is astoundingly high, and it requires the development of software tools that have both a strict and clear structure and that are resilient to errors that will manifest when developing complex code. Workflows are a straightforward way to maintain structure in toolchains that grow increasingly complex. Workflow management packages such as Luigi bring functionality to run different tasks in parallel, keep track of completed tasks and improve the reproducibility. This poster will present two Blue Brain Project software tools, the e-model-packages software and BluePyEModel, focusing on the creation and distribution of in-silico neuron cells. The e-model-packages software collects cells from an in-silico brain circuit and arranges them in individual ‘neuron packages’ to be distributed to the public through the Blue Brain online portals. The cells packages it creates are designed to be easily run with the open source EModelRunner package. The BluePyEModel software creates and optimizes in-silico neurons and is able to reproduce features from real neuronal experiment recordings. Under the hood, it uses the open source BluePyEfe and eFel packages to extract the electrophysiological features from experimental cells, and the open source BluePyOpt simulator to optimize and validate the parameters of the in-silico neurons.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"On the benefits of using workflows: insights from two software tools in the context of computational neuroscience","description":"","duration":"45","python_level":"","domain_level":"","delivery":"in-person","room":"Forum","start":"2022-07-13T12:10:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T12:55:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8KEVYF","9LFFBL","E7CX9K","N3HJ87","NUF3K9","YYQBM3"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/on-the-benefits-of-using-workflows-insights-from-two-software-tools-in-the-context-of-computational-neuroscience"},{"code":"YYQBM3","title":"Choosing the right database for your next project - Looking at options beyond PostgreSQL and MySQL","speakers":[{"code":"QYTJB9","name":"Marc-Andre Lemburg","biography":"Marc-Andre is the CEO and founder of eGenix.com, a Python-focused project and consulting company based in Germany, specializing in the data, finance and database space.
