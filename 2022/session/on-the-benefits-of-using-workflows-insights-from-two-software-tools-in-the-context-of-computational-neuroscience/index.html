The amount of data and code this implies is astoundingly high, and it requires the development of software tools that have both a strict and clear structure and that are resilient to errors that will manifest when developing complex code. Workflows are a straightforward way to maintain structure in toolchains that grow increasingly complex. Workflow management packages such as Luigi bring functionality to run different tasks in parallel, keep track of completed tasks and improve the reproducibility. This poster will present two Blue Brain Project software tools, the e-model-packages software and BluePyEModel, focusing on the creation and distribution of in-silico neuron cells. The e-model-packages software collects cells from an in-silico brain circuit and arranges them in individual ‘neuron packages’ to be distributed to the public through the Blue Brain online portals. The cells packages it creates are designed to be easily run with the open source EModelRunner package. The BluePyEModel software creates and optimizes in-silico neurons and is able to reproduce features from real neuronal experiment recordings. Under the hood, it uses the open source BluePyEfe and eFel packages to extract the electrophysiological features from experimental cells, and the open source BluePyOpt simulator to optimize and validate the parameters of the in-silico neurons.</p><p><span class="tag">Poster</span><span class="tag">Posters</span></p></article><hr/><article class="accent-left"><h2 class="h5">The speaker</h2><div><p class="large"><a href="/speaker/aurelien-jaquier" class="speaker-link">Aurélien Jaquier</a></p><p>Hi, my name is Aurélien Jaquier, from Switzerland, I am 27 and I currently work for the Blue Brain Project as a Scientific Software Developer.

Yet… the client has lost his interest: maybe right now he says that he has already come up with his own temporary solution and he has no intention to switch to another one?  Building internal products differs from commercial ones - there is no flow of cash and your clients are fully transparent.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I would like to share with you my experience and tips connected with developing such internal tools and standards.

We were able to fight through text files, user inputs, and geodata of all sorts and say goodbye to manual processing thanks to Python and its geospatial and data processing libraries. On the technical side, the presentation should introduce some of the handy geospatial and data processing tools to get your hands on any task, from producing colorful maps to analyzing time trends in satellite imagery.

And do you have blocks of code that must not be called concurrently? Maybe you didn't even realise it until your system experienced a bug you could not reproduce until the stars aligned. Then you surely know that hope is not the answer to a robust system, we must be prepared to face worst-case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis talk will first briefly present race conditions, a staple in concurrent computing. We will then compare implicit and explicit concurrency management in your core logic, that is whether you delegate or craft protective logic yourself. Next comes testing, the real crux of the talk, where we will demonstrate how to manufacture a race condition. Finally we will explore how to solve such problems with the built-in tools the Python standard library offers.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Get a quick tour of race condition handling in Python: what it is, the built-in tools, and how to test for it.","description":"Anybody working with concurrency (threads, processes, or more abstractly workers) eventually encounters a _race condition_. This kind of hair-pulling problem is a staple in computer science. Sometimes you can offload the problem to a lower layer, usually to the database engine, bundling it with atomic transactions. But there are times when you have to take charge of worst-case concurrency scenarios, when your architecture and constraints do not leave room for implicit concurrency management. Then, you need to carefully craft the paths in and out of the critical section, avoiding deadlocks along the way.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will focus on how to test your program with a manufactured race condition. If you know it can happen, you'd better cover it in your test suite. We will define a server program called in parallel by multiple clients to illustrate the problem at hand. Then, we will manually set-up a race condition during testing to explore broken behaviour and problematic code.\r\n\r\nThe Python standard library offers all the tools we need to cater for race conditions. We hope the tour we will give allows you to exercise your own race conditions more easily.
