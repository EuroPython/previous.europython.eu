website is the best way to make geographic data easily accessible to users because it represents, in a simple way, the information relating to a specific geographical area and is in fact used by many online services.\r\n\r\nImplementing a web *map* can be complex and many adopt the strategy of using external services, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a major data and cost management problem.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll see how to create a web *map* with the **Python** based web framework **Django** using its **GeoDjango** module, storing geographic data in your local database on
