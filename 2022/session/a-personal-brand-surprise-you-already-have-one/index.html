He is curious to build products that can solve simple and complex problems but in a graceful way. \r\nSanket has always been a forefront runner for writing high-quality code. But he also understands that it is a gradual process and thus it is important to always look back every few months and refractor the code whenever possible so that it's easier to debug in case of any issues. \r\nHe has taken multiple workshops in the past to promote the same and encouraged many engineers to not neglect the power of well refactored code. \r\nHe has taught more than 15000 budding engineers and wants to create a community of people with impactful skills. He runs a YouTube channel with a 25k+ subscriber base where he shares unpopular opinions and his tech journey experiences. \r\nIn his free time, he likes to play chess and mentor budding engineers in the industry.","avatar":"https://program.europython.eu/media/avatars/9579-200o200o2-NhELdkcqcQAigZMCd47Efx_gFsCRU8.jpeg","slug":"sanket-singh","affiliation":"Google","homepage":null,"twitter":null}],"submission_type":"Talk","slug":"when-grpc-met-python","track":"Web","state":"confirmed","abstract":"What if we can have a tool that helps us to do intelligent load balancing or What if we can do selective compression of the data and extremely fast and light weight transfer of data?

Using gRPC our client can directly make a call to a server on a different machine as if it were a local object. gRPC has low latency, high scalability and supports multiple use cases for distributed system. We can even build mobile clients which can communicate to a cloud server. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers which is an open source mechanism for serialising structured data, which makes payloads faster, smaller and simpler. In this talk we will try to understand how can we get started with gRPC in Python. grpcio package of python will be used for the demonstration of the examples and we will cover basics of gRPC as well. We will build a basic gRPC service and define protocol buffers for it. Demonstration of how a client and a server can be made through gRPC and how can they communicate.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Wicklow Hall 1","start":"2022-07-14T14:00:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T14:30:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["3U9T9S","8JSS8X","CFRUXG","HN3NNP","P3EV3C","RMLCKR"],"talks_after":["8D9LD8","RWKPFX","SE83WQ","SHXRMJ"],"next_talk_code":"SHXRMJ","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/when-grpc-met-python"},{"code":"CFRUXG","title":"Synergize AI and Domain Expertise - Explainability Check with Python","speakers":[{"code":"CCZUDR","name":"Pranjal Biyani","biography":"Pranjal is an experienced AI Scientist building the first AI powered platform to accelerate R\u0026D for Material Sciences across the globe.
