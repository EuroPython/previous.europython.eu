Currently, Python‚Äôs presence within secondary and post-secondary schools varies greatly between different institutions, but the continuity in the lack of interdisciplinary coursework is a key limiting factor in the widespread growth of computing education. This is due to a variety of factors, including stereotypes and policy issues, but the bottom line is that Python being restricted to only computing classes restricts career opportunities and misrepresents the professional world. With support from a case-study of college-level physics students exposed to scientific programming, we propose novel methods of integrating Python into traditional coursework during this talk. The overarching mission of this discussion is to demonstrate how Python literacy in non-computing coursework can ultimately help in streamlining processes and accelerating progress in various industries. Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about the exciting prospect of expanding Python beyond the confines of computer science, and will have an exclusive look at a case-study that offers insight into student benefits of integrated coursework: as concerned stakeholders, it is ultimately well-informed Python community members who must unite to make a positive impact on the education system.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"To the detriment of education systems around the world, Python remains confined to only computer science classes. Come see why Python‚Äôs currentstatus within education is a problem via a case-study of students, and learn how you can make a difference!","description":"Introduction and Motivation: \r\n\r\nThe goal of many within the Python community has been to increase the reach of computer science education in classrooms and institutions around the world. Various studies have pointed out the problem-solving and planning abilities forged by computer science coursework (Salehi et al., 2020; Arf√© et al., 2020), and other research has investigated the social stigma (McCartney et al., 2017) and instructor bottlenecks (Raman et al., 2015) that inhibit accessibility to computer science courses. In recent years, significant steps have been taken towards increasing computer science education. However, most of these efforts are largely focused on the introduction of standalone computer science courses rather than integrated coursework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore the seldom-discussed idea of integrating programming into traditional, non-computing fields such as mathematics, social studies, and science. Interdisciplinary coursework is not a new concept in education: students in an English class are expected to be able to understand, produce, and analyze data visualizations, and mathematics students learn to communicate their work formally in language (Lynch, 2020). However, the current belief in the education realm is that computer science is only for a small sect of highly capable students expressing a deep career interest in the field, a clear misconception that has been debunked by studies (Patitsas et al., 2019) and the experiences of countless professionals applying computational resources in traditionally non-computing industries. As a result of such factors, computer science education is fundamentally isolated from the core curriculum, which is to the detriment of learners and the fields that they pursue. \r\n\r\nIn support of the discussion, we unveil the results of surveys given to physics students enrolled in college-level coursework. In this case-study, students of varied backgrounds in computing are given a lecture on chaotic dynamical systems, and are then shown Python-implemented Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods and simulations to solve and visualize the systems. The insights provided by these students provide great perspective on benefits, reception, and nuances in integrating Python into core classes. Overwhelmingly, many indicated that they believed that the Python demonstrations aided in their understanding of the material. For the attendee, this exclusive look at a case-study will help develop a well-informed perspective on the role of Python beyond just computer science.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the presentation with recommendations for integrated Python coursework, calling for global policymakers and Python community members to step forward and do their part as stakeholders. We pinpoint why Python is the best choice, touching on factors such as its readable syntax, high volume of functional open-source libraries, ever-growing industry demand. The versatility afforded by such elements makes learners of all backgrounds better equipped for solving the challenging problems they will face in their careers. Community members in attendance will gain essential knowledge regarding the issue of Python integration, making them better equipped to argue on behalf of the educational community.\r\n\r\nFor students, seeing how complex differential equations can be numerically approached and solved by computers, understanding how new solar systems are discovered by crunching vast astronomical data, and witnessing a computer rapidly sequence a lengthy DNA chain forges an instant, permanent connection that fosters career interests and prepares students for an increasingly computerized professional world. We seek to advocate for every student to have this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway for talk attendees will be a fresh perspective on the issue of Python‚Äôs absence beyond the confines of computer science coursework, as well as methods for mitigation and steps that they can take. Changing education with programming is a long-term investment that will unequivocally accelerate student preparedness and capabilities, but it begins with the focused efforts of an informed public rallying in support of progress. \r\n\r\nSchedule and Format:\r\n\r\n5 minutes: The problem of computer science in education and why we should focus on increasing Python‚Äôs role in non-computing classes\r\n\r\n10 minutes: Presenting research: a case study on introducing scientific Python to physics students\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Why Python is the best option and the role and impact on the Python community\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Proposals for Solutions to the Problem\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Question and Answer Session","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey B","start":"2022-07-14T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T12:25:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","MZS3MM","S8XSTF","WWRGSS"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"JBHNRE","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/revolutionizing-education-how-python-is-essential-beyond-computer-science"}],"sessionsInParallel":[{"code":"HAKFFR","title":"How we are making Python 3.11 faster","speakers":[{"code":"LUY39H","name":"Mark Shannon","biography":"I've been using Python since 2005.\r\nI have an extensive background in compilers, virtual machines and static analysis for dynamic languages, specifically Python.\r\nAfter a long interlude working on static analysis tools, I have returned to performance work over the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nI am currently working as technical lead with the \"Faster CPython\" team funded by Microsoft.","avatar":"https://program.europython.eu/media/avatars/IMG_20191130_122850_3mkOJrs.jpg","slug":"mark-shannon","affiliation":"HotPy Ltd","homepage":null,"twitter":null}],"submission_type":"Talk","slug":"how-we-are-making-python-3-11-faster","track":"(c)Python Internals","state":"confirmed","abstract":"Python 3.11 is between 10% and 60% faster than Python 3.10, depending on the application. \r\nWe have achieved this in a fully portable way by making the interpreter adapt to the \r\nprogram being run, and by streamlining key data structures.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain what changes we have made, and how they improve performance.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Python 3.11 is faster than 3.10.

Nowadays scikit-learn is of one the most used scientific library in the world for data analysis. It provides reference implementations of many methods and algorithms to a userbase of millions.\r\n\r\nWith the renewed interest in machine-learning based methods in the last years, other libraries providing efficient and highly optimised methods (such as for instance LightGBM and XGBoost for Gradient-Boosting-based methods) have emerged. Those libraries have encountered a similar success, and have put performance and computational efficiency as top priorities.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the recent work carried over by the scikit-learn core-developers team to improve its native performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover elements of the PyData ecosystem and the CPython interpreter with an emphasis on their impact on performances. Computationally expensive patterns will then be covered before presenting the technical choices associated with the new routines implementations, keeping the project requirements in mind. At the end, we will take a quick look at the future work and collaborations on hardware-specialised computational routines.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 2","start":"2022-07-14T11:20:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T11:50:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["F9M9BR","HAKFFR","JBHNRE","KPW7X7","XUCMH3"],"talks_after":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","MZS3MM","S8XSTF","WWRGSS","XSRUNF"],"next_talk_code":"8YX9RG","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/scaling-scikit-learn-introducing-new-sets-of-computational-routines"},{"code":"XUCMH3","title":"A Network Embeddings based Recommendation Model with multi-factor consideration","speakers":[{"code":"JFZNJ9","name":"ABHISHEK","biography":"Abhishek is a leading Innovation Specialist and a distinguished digital transformation leader who has worked across diversified domains retail, finance, logistics and enterprise technology.

Traditionally we use interaction information based on user preferences and item characteristics. This brings in collaborative filtering-driven recommendations with higher accuracy and relevance. However, such a method has certain limitations in utilizing implicit information like cross-domain specific factors that are equally important for making personalized recommendations. We propose an improvised way of using network embeddings based matrix factorization technique with multi-factors to make a match between both implicit and explicit features resulting in more accurate recommendation.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"A Network Embeddings based Recommendation Model with multi-factor consideration","description":"The method consists of three main steps: First, network embedding formulation performed on each user specific behavior network; Then, embeddings weight distribution estimated through intermediate layers of network with final layer for target (item purchased as labels); Finally, both factors: (a) Learned weights from implicit data (cross-domain) and (b) explicit factors from domain data used by multi-factorization method for recommendations. \r\nThe proposed method transfers knowledge across implicit and explicit factors and associated dimensions. The suggested approach tested real-world data with evidence of outperforming existing algorithms with significant lift in recommendation accuracy. Empirical experimentation outcomes illustrate the potential of both factors for making effective recommendations.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-14T11:20:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T11:50:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["F9M9BR","HAKFFR","JBHNRE","KPW7X7","ULWUP3"],"talks_after":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","MZS3MM","S8XSTF","WWRGSS","XSRUNF"],"next_talk_code":"S8XSTF","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/a-network-embeddings-based-recommendation-model-with-multi-factor-consideration"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"maps-with-django"},"buildId":"TLlzm4r8yGVCzFtabSCgh","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
