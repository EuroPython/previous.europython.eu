Discussing pip, pipenv, and poetry, presenting each of their weak and strong points. Also intend to present how to package and publish a simple code with each one of them, and suggest which package manager should you choose, whether you are just starting with python, or feel like there is something bothering and never knew you could solve it easily and painless.\r\n\r\nSlides can be accessed here:\r\nhttps://github.com/vinigfer/europython_2022_slides","abstract_as_a_tweet":"From pip to poetry - Python (many) ways of packaging and publishing","description":"","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey B","start":"2022-07-13T11:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T12:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["DYDA3H","KMCFKN","MADLNQ","STQEKX","ZYAD7Z"],"talks_after":["8KEVYF","9LFFBL","E7CX9K","N3HJ87","NUF3K9","QQJFSS","YYQBM3"],"next_talk_code":"9LFFBL","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/from-pip-to-poetry-python-many-ways-of-packaging-and-publishing"},{"code":"KMCFKN","title":"Data Warehouses Meet Data Lakes","speakers":[{"code":"8MDEKJ","name":"Mauro","biography":"Mauro Pelucchi is a senior data scientist and big data engineer \r\nresponsible for the design of the \"Real-Time Labour Market Information System on Skill Requirements\" for CEDEFOP.\r\n\r\nHe currently works as Head of Global Data Science @ EMSI Burning-Glass with the goal to develop innovative models, methods and deployments of labour market data and other data to meet customer requirements and prototype new potential solutions.

There’s a better way: automatically publishing new packages merely by merging pull requests.","description":"Empowering anyone to issue a new release by submitting a pull request? At first glance, it seems like an outlandish idea. Upon further inspection, however, the benefits become clear.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest sources of friction in software development is packaging and publishing new releases. Somebody has to sift through the commits and write a change-log, tag it with a new version number, and publish the package to PyPI. And usually only one or two people have the access necessary for this last step.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate result is an infrequent release cadence. Bug fixes and new features are sitting there in the `main` branch, but hardly anybody is benefiting from them because they aren’t in a shipped release yet.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there’s a better way: a continuous release process where new versions are auto-published via pull requests — without any manual monkeying.\r\n\r\nIn this environment, all pull requests must include a release file that describes the changes within. This file must also include whether the new version should be a major, minor, or patch release.\r\n\r\nThe continuous integration (CI) process looks for this file, and if one hasn’t been included, the tests will fail, and the pull request won’t be merged. Otherwise, a maintainer merges the pull request, and the CI process then uses the release file to put the description into the change-log, increment the version number, commit, tag, build, and publish the new release to PyPI.\r\n\r\nSo with almost no human input, every code contribution results in a new release in a matter of minutes. Every feature and bug-fix has its own release, without anyone having to remember to package and publish a new version. Plus, if a bug is found, it’s now much easier to trace it to a specific release version.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best part is that all contributors get to issue their own releases. What better way to welcome new contributors than to reward them with a dedicated release composed entirely of their own work?\r\n\r\nAttendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and skills:\r\n\r\n* what kinds of problems are introduced by an infrequent release cadence\r\n* how automated releases solve those problems and provide myriad ancillary benefits\r\n* how to format and parse the release file\r\n* how to use continuous integration (CI) systems to automate releases\r\n* how to add deployment code so new versions are released when PRs are merged\r\n* how to use [AutoPub](https://github.com/autopub/autopub) to facilitate this process","duration":"30","python_level":"none","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"The Auditorium","start":"2022-07-13T11:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T12:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["DYDA3H","G7MNXY","KMCFKN","STQEKX","ZYAD7Z"],"talks_after":["8KEVYF","9LFFBL","E7CX9K","N3HJ87","NUF3K9","QQJFSS","YYQBM3"],"next_talk_code":"E7CX9K","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/python-packaging-automation-auto-publish-to-pypi-via-pull-requests"},{"code":"STQEKX","title":"Using python to predict Asset price reversals.","speakers":[{"code":"K379P3","name":"Niall O'Connor","biography":"Niall started coding on a sord m5 in 1984, love coding.

In my own adventures living in Zimbabwe, I’ve always encountered ibises (the bird versions) perched on top of elephants. If you’ve never seen an elephant in real life I can confirm that they are huge, complex creatures. The image of a small bird sitting on top of a large elephant serves as a metaphor for how ibis (the package) provides a less complex, more performant way for Pythonistas to interact with multiple big data engines. \r\n\r\nI'll use the metaphor of elephants and ibises to show how this package can make a data workflow more Pythonic. The Zen of Python lets us know that simple is better than complex. The bigger and more complex your data, the more of an argument there is to use Ibis. Raw SQL can be quite difficult to maintain when your queries are very complex. For Python programmers, Ibis offers a way to write SQL in Python that allows for unit-testing, composability, and abstraction over specific query engines (e.g.BigQuery)! You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"In this talk, I will be sharing about Ibis, a software package that provides a more Pythonic way of interacting with multiple database engines.","description":"A few weeks ago I was working on setting up a relational database to explore records from DataSF’s Civic Art Collection. Whenever I attend a tech conference I try to spend a day or two in the city to check out its cultural scene, so this seemed like useful information! I decided to use MySQL as my database engine. Coming from a Pandas background I was surprised by how unproductive and restricted I felt writing raw SQL queries. I also spent a significant amount of time resolving errors in queries that worked with one flavor of SQL but failed with MySQL. Throughout the process, I kept thinking to myself if only there was a more Pythonic way!!! A few weeks later I was introduced to Ibis. \r\n\r\nI live in Zimbabwe and the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of the word ibis is a safari. One of my favorite things to do when I'm not working is to go on a game drive. Whenever I've been adventuring on safari I usually see ibises perched on top of an elephant. The contrast between the creatures is stark! The African Sacred Ibis is a small, elegant creature that's named after the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. While as many of us know, an elephant is a very big and complex animal. This image serves as a great metaphor for the Python package and how it interacts with big database engines.  \r\n\r\nIbis allows you to write intuitive Python code and have that code be translated into SQL. Whether you’re wanting to interact with SQL databases or wanting to use distributed DBMSs, Ibis lets you do this in Python. You can think of the python code as the less complex elegant layer sitting on top of any big data engine of your choice. At the moment, Ibis supports quite a few backends including:\r\n\r\nTraditional DBMSs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite Analytical DBMSs: OmniSciDB, ClickHouse, Datafusion Distributed DBMSs: Impala, PySpark, BigQuery In memory analytics: pandas and Dask. \r\n\r\nAnything you can write in an SQL select statement you can write in Ibis. You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. In this talk, we'll go through several examples of these and compare what the SQL code would look like versus writing to the database with Ibis.

As a final step, we will also configure a `CI` (continuous integration) pipeline using `GitHub Actions` and `Codecov` to automate this process in our remote repository.","duration":"45","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-13T10:45:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-13T11:30:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["3XNT9R","83QRQG","8SJSVS","CJYTER","S9ANCN"],"talks_after":["DYDA3H","G7MNXY","KMCFKN","MADLNQ","STQEKX","ZYAD7Z"],"next_talk_code":"DYDA3H","prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/code-coverage-through-unit-tests-running-in-sub-processes-threads-locally-and-automated-on-github"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"localstack-turbocharging-dev-loops-and-team-collaboration-for-cloud-applications"},"buildId":"0ezuoYF1Bh36D37zGfmfs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
