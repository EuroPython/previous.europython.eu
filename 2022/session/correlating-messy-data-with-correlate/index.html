We will use Python as our weapon of choice to slowly discuss how you would \r\ngo about building the different components of a database.\r\n\r\n1) Talking to your Database: We start by building out an interface and a language that helps us communicate with our database. We will use the Prompt toolkit to build a REPL \u0026 use a simple SQL-based language with basic regular expressions that can parse it to instruction to execute.\r\n\r\n2) Working with Data: Now that we can communicate with our database using instructions. we start the actual work in building out the Datastore, We initially store all the data in a simple in-memory dictionary and then move to persist this data to disk. We now read the data from the disk to memory every time we query the data and write back the data to the disk but this makes things very slow :(\r\nThis problem is our entry into the beautiful world of Indexes so by building a very basic Btree index to store references in memory to quickly access only what we require from the data on disk we can actually speed up our access times for basic row access queries from O(N) to O(1) where N is the number of rows in a table\r\n\r\n3) Future: We can now proudly demo our new and polished database that can store data, persist it, and can run queries that are quite fast thanks to our Btree Indexes. We also discuss how this Database can be improved in the future by supporting full ACID Transactions, allowing concurrency, and handling locks\r\n\r\nOur Database journey now comes to an End and As they say, The best way to understand something is to build it yourself :)","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-14T16:05:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T16:35:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["9VWGLC","BNJPUH","JJQSXA","QMZDVX","ZSCTME"],"talks_after":["LCCECR"],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"LCNBCC","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/build-a-database-with-python"},{"code":"QMZDVX","title":"Is the news media polarized?

This project consists of a set of experiments on similar data-sets from news\r\nagencies across the various subsets in the ”media-bias” chart. News Media perceived bias\r\nis common across consumers that belong to various political affiliations. While anecdotal\r\nevidence of this exists and there exist annotated datasets that aim to annotate the ”spin”\r\na news agency puts on certain events and entities, whether this is a widespread problem\r\nand whether it can be detected by the neural network topically or temporally is a problem that needs to be explored. The news media bias analysis is modelled as a Natural\r\nLanguage Processing sentiment analysis task and a fake news binary classification task to\r\ndeduce the level of polarization in a neural network by feeding it headlines embedded using\r\npre-trained sentiment models from news publications across the political spectrum. When\r\nit came to fake news vulnerability, news from all kinds of perceived politically affiliated\r\nnews media holds up well against a fake news dataset with a very good accuracy. None of\r\nthe accuracies dropped below 95%. This is a significant result that sort of debunks the AllSlides categorization","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Is news media polarization based in fact or is it conditioned due to the consumption of alternative news media?","description":"This work is an example of an intersection of a non\r\nscientific field with computer science and mathematics, trying to quantify, measure and identify\r\nnon mathematical phenomena in the language of mathematics. It is important because it could\r\nbe the basis of the scientific approaches that the next generation policy makers, voters, non\r\nprofit social organizations and governments could use to make life changing decisions for their\r\ncitizens.\r\n2\r\nThe questions that this study tries to answer is whether a neural network can learn biases from\r\nthe news media based on perceived bias scores obtained from independent agencies. It also\r\nseeks to answer whether any of these political leanings of the news media affect the vulnerability of their consumer when it comes to fake news. The results of this experiment aim to show\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n1. SVMs perform better clustering with respect to the categories than neural networks, however the maximum does not cross 67%\r\n2. The most significant conclusion from this work is that though there is a perceived bias\r\nwhen it comes to news agencies, when looked at from a neural networks standpoint, it\r\nis negligible. Mainstream news agencies are not able to polarize a neural network with\r\ninherent biases in their headlines.\r\n3. There may be topical biases that need to be examined by using an Entity linking and bias\r\ncalculation approach\r\n4. Most mainstream news agencies do not make the consumer vulnerable to believing fake\r\nnews. This study needs to be conducted with data from popular social media ”news”\r\ngroups or popular TV shows that masquerade as news but may technically not even be\r\nnews channels.\r\n5. It is safe to conclude that the perceived bias that stems from social media polarization is\r\nbeing extended to news media when their contribution to the polarization may be negligible.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey Hall 2","start":"2022-07-14T16:05:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T16:35:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["9VWGLC","BNJPUH","JJQSXA","NL8HRY","ZSCTME"],"talks_after":["LCCECR"],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"JWUZ7E","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/is-the-news-media-polarized-or-are-we-being-conditioned-to-think-it-is"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"correlating-messy-data-with-correlate"},"buildId":"0ezuoYF1Bh36D37zGfmfs","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
