The area of security in MLOps has seen a rise in attention as machine learning infrastructure expands to further critical usecases across industry. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we introduce the conceptual and practical topics around MLSecOps that data science practitioners will be able to adopt or advocate for. We will also provide an intuition on key security challenges that arise in production machine learning systems as well as best practices and frameworks that can be adopted to help mitigate security risks in ML models, ML pipelines and ML services. \r\n\r\nWe will cover a practical example showing how we can secure a machine learning model, and showcasing the security risks and best practices that can be adopted during the feature engineering, model training, model deployment and model monitoring stages of the machine learning lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Benefits to the ecosystem\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide practitioners with the intuition and tools to secure production machine learning systems, as well as further the discussion around best practices reinforcing SecOps into MLOps.\r\n\r\nIt will provide best practices on a critical area of machine learning operations which is of paramount importance in production.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey B","start":"2022-07-15T14:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T15:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["9PQZKF","GAVCZ8","PAXMHN","TXFX77"],"talks_after":["3ZGCQR","7UYS9V","BZL7YY","JBTGFL","TDUFJ9","WVFUYA"],"next_talk_code":"WVFUYA","prev_talk_code":"SGP3PM","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/secure-python-ml-the-major-security-flaws-in-the-ml-lifecycle-and-how-to-avoid-them"},{"code":"GAVCZ8","title":"Try Something Different: Explore MicroPython!

The extra work needed to do the right thing competes with the almost overwhelming need for new development, and unclear code ownership and lack of insight into the size and scope of type problems add to the burden. We’ve greatly mitigated these problems by building an automated refactoring pipeline that applies Black formatting and backfills missing types via incremental Github pull requests. Our refactor applications use LibCST and MonkeyType to modify the Python syntax tree and use GitPython/PyGithub to create and manage pull requests. It divides changes into small, easily reviewed pull requests and assigns appropriate code owners to review them. After creating and merging more than 3,000 pull requests, we have fully converted our large codebase to Black format and have added type annotations to more than 50,000 functions. In this talk, you’ll learn to use LibCST to build automated refactoring tools that fix general Python code quality issues at scale and how to use GitPython/PyGithub to automate the code review process.\r\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/jimmy_lai/europython-2022-automated-refactoring-large-python-codebases","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Automated refactoring on large Python codebases for adopting Black formatting and type annotation with incremental changes by using open source LibCST, GitPython and PyGithub.","description":"","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-15T14:35:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T15:05:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["9PQZKF","BADDYW","GAVCZ8","PAXMHN"],"talks_after":["3ZGCQR","7UYS9V","BZL7YY","JBTGFL","TDUFJ9","WVFUYA"],"next_talk_code":"3ZGCQR","prev_talk_code":"9EH9PG","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/automated-refactoring-large-python-codebases"}],"sessionsInParallel":[{"code":"8RH3BC","title":"Saving Lives with Predictive Geo - AI","speakers":[{"code":"33UKLN","name":"Sumedh Ghatage","biography":"Sumedh Ghatage is an Associate Lead Data Scientist (Geospatial) at Gramener.
