Over the decades, scientists have been using theoretical and experimental approaches to understand the brain. With the recent advancement of computer systems and the availability of big data, a new discipline, namely simulation neuroscience, is emerged as a complementary approach alongside experimental, theoretical and clinical neuroscience. As the name suggests, simulation neuroscience attempts to understand the brain by simulating it in a computer.\r\nHere we present EModelRunner, a Python package designed to run the simulated neuron model implementations provided by the Blue Brain Project online portals. It is capable of simulating biologically detailed neuron models. A neuron model describes a single cell in the brain and consists of a morphology and equations that simulate its electrical behavior. EModelRunner uses the Neuron simulator under the hood. The Neuron simulator is implemented in C++, but also provides a Python interface to the user. For computing the properties of the membrane channels, Neuron uses compiled mechanisms written using the Neuron Model Description Language (NMODL). EModelRunner abstracts away the Neuron and NMODL implementation layers from the end-users and provides them with a pure Python API. It supplies the users with the ability to customize the properties of the neurons and apply various stimuli to them in order to observe their behavior. Another use-case for the EModelRunner is to provide a standard way of running the neuron models provided by the Blue Brain Project.","duration":"45","python_level":"","domain_level":"","delivery":"in-person","room":"Forum","start":"2022-07-14T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T12:55:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","S8XSTF","WWRGSS","XSRUNF"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/emodelrunner-a-python-package-to-run-online-available-biological-neuron-model-implementations"},{"code":"S8XSTF","title":"ShapePipe: A modular weak-lensing processing and analysis pipeline","speakers":[{"code":"VFV3HW","name":"Samuel FARRENS","biography":"I am a researcher at the CosmoStat lab in CEA Paris-Saclay.

From the largest galaxies down to the smallest Python programmers our story begins with the **Big Bang**. The particles that make up all of things we can touch and see only account for 5% of the energy density of the Universe. Leaving us quite literally in the dark! Weak gravitational lensing, a barely perceptible change to the shape of **galaxies** that we observe, is an indispensable tool for understanding the nature of **dark matter** and **dark energy**. However, measuring the shape of galaxies to the precision required is actually quite a tricky problem.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more interesting? 😁\r\n\r\n#### What does this have to do with Python?\r\n\r\nWell, Python has steadily become the standard programming language for cosmologists over the last decade or so... and we are no exception! In this talk I will describe the tools we have developed in Python to help us solve some of the problems with measuring the shapes of galaxies and how various existing Python packages have made this possible. \r\n\r\nWe hope that some of the things we have learned could be useful to other teams, in particular those developing scientific software.\r\n\r\n##### Resources\r\n- [ShapePipe Repository](https://github.com/CosmoStat/shapepipe)\r\n- [ShapePipe Documentation](https://cosmostat.github.io/shapepipe/)\r\n- [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vQYCV1278oUvFzqGID6yhbQwwDyboCIv/view?usp=sharing)","duration":"45","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-14T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T12:40:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","MZS3MM","WWRGSS","XSRUNF"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"XUCMH3","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/shapepipe-a-modular-weak-lensing-processing-and-analysis-pipeline"},{"code":"WWRGSS","title":"Async Django","speakers":[{"code":"7HPWPW","name":"Ivaylo Donchev","biography":"Currently working as Technical team lead in HackSoft in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nA programmer for ~7 years, working with Python and DJango for 6 years.\r\n\r\nSpeaker at EuroPython 2018 and PyCon Balkan 2018.","avatar":"https://program.europython.eu/media/avatars/personal_KPiB7nc.jpg","slug":"ivaylo-donchev","affiliation":"HackSoft","homepage":"https://github.com/Ivo-Donchev","twitter":null}],"submission_type":"Talk","slug":"async-django","track":"Django","state":"confirmed","abstract":"Python has a full set of tools for asynchronous programming - multiprocessing, multithreading, coroutines, etc. And Django uses most of them.\r\n\r\nSince Django 3, we have the ability to create fully async non-blocking Django views that could handle thousands of requests concurrently.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll focus on 2 key topics:\r\n1.

Currently, Python’s presence within secondary and post-secondary schools varies greatly between different institutions, but the continuity in the lack of interdisciplinary coursework is a key limiting factor in the widespread growth of computing education. This is due to a variety of factors, including stereotypes and policy issues, but the bottom line is that Python being restricted to only computing classes restricts career opportunities and misrepresents the professional world. With support from a case-study of college-level physics students exposed to scientific programming, we propose novel methods of integrating Python into traditional coursework during this talk. The overarching mission of this discussion is to demonstrate how Python literacy in non-computing coursework can ultimately help in streamlining processes and accelerating progress in various industries. Attendees will have the opportunity to hear about the exciting prospect of expanding Python beyond the confines of computer science, and will have an exclusive look at a case-study that offers insight into student benefits of integrated coursework: as concerned stakeholders, it is ultimately well-informed Python community members who must unite to make a positive impact on the education system.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"To the detriment of education systems around the world, Python remains confined to only computer science classes. Come see why Python’s currentstatus within education is a problem via a case-study of students, and learn how you can make a difference!","description":"Introduction and Motivation: \r\n\r\nThe goal of many within the Python community has been to increase the reach of computer science education in classrooms and institutions around the world. Various studies have pointed out the problem-solving and planning abilities forged by computer science coursework (Salehi et al., 2020; Arfé et al., 2020), and other research has investigated the social stigma (McCartney et al., 2017) and instructor bottlenecks (Raman et al., 2015) that inhibit accessibility to computer science courses. In recent years, significant steps have been taken towards increasing computer science education. However, most of these efforts are largely focused on the introduction of standalone computer science courses rather than integrated coursework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore the seldom-discussed idea of integrating programming into traditional, non-computing fields such as mathematics, social studies, and science. Interdisciplinary coursework is not a new concept in education: students in an English class are expected to be able to understand, produce, and analyze data visualizations, and mathematics students learn to communicate their work formally in language (Lynch, 2020). However, the current belief in the education realm is that computer science is only for a small sect of highly capable students expressing a deep career interest in the field, a clear misconception that has been debunked by studies (Patitsas et al., 2019) and the experiences of countless professionals applying computational resources in traditionally non-computing industries. As a result of such factors, computer science education is fundamentally isolated from the core curriculum, which is to the detriment of learners and the fields that they pursue. \r\n\r\nIn support of the discussion, we unveil the results of surveys given to physics students enrolled in college-level coursework. In this case-study, students of varied backgrounds in computing are given a lecture on chaotic dynamical systems, and are then shown Python-implemented Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods and simulations to solve and visualize the systems. The insights provided by these students provide great perspective on benefits, reception, and nuances in integrating Python into core classes. Overwhelmingly, many indicated that they believed that the Python demonstrations aided in their understanding of the material. For the attendee, this exclusive look at a case-study will help develop a well-informed perspective on the role of Python beyond just computer science.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the presentation with recommendations for integrated Python coursework, calling for global policymakers and Python community members to step forward and do their part as stakeholders. We pinpoint why Python is the best choice, touching on factors such as its readable syntax, high volume of functional open-source libraries, ever-growing industry demand. The versatility afforded by such elements makes learners of all backgrounds better equipped for solving the challenging problems they will face in their careers. Community members in attendance will gain essential knowledge regarding the issue of Python integration, making them better equipped to argue on behalf of the educational community.\r\n\r\nFor students, seeing how complex differential equations can be numerically approached and solved by computers, understanding how new solar systems are discovered by crunching vast astronomical data, and witnessing a computer rapidly sequence a lengthy DNA chain forges an instant, permanent connection that fosters career interests and prepares students for an increasingly computerized professional world. We seek to advocate for every student to have this opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway for talk attendees will be a fresh perspective on the issue of Python’s absence beyond the confines of computer science coursework, as well as methods for mitigation and steps that they can take. Changing education with programming is a long-term investment that will unequivocally accelerate student preparedness and capabilities, but it begins with the focused efforts of an informed public rallying in support of progress. \r\n\r\nSchedule and Format:\r\n\r\n5 minutes: The problem of computer science in education and why we should focus on increasing Python’s role in non-computing classes\r\n\r\n10 minutes: Presenting research: a case study on introducing scientific Python to physics students\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Why Python is the best option and the role and impact on the Python community\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Proposals for Solutions to the Problem\r\n\r\n5 minutes: Question and Answer Session","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"remote","room":"Liffey B","start":"2022-07-14T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-14T12:25:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["8YX9RG","FBRMPN","H79EHW","MZS3MM","S8XSTF","WWRGSS"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"JBHNRE","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/revolutionizing-education-how-python-is-essential-beyond-computer-science"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/session/[slug]","query":{"slug":"online-voting-system-used-for-primary-elections-for-the-french-presidential-must-be-secure-right"},"buildId":"TLlzm4r8yGVCzFtabSCgh","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
