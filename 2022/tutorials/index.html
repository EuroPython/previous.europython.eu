I am sorry, but they are not that ‚Äúmagic‚Äù!
I agree they are really cool, but dunder methods (the name they usually go by) are just regular Python methods that you implement!
And it is my job to help <strong>you</strong> learn about them.</p><p><strong>Dunder methods</strong> are the methods that you need to implement when you want your objects to interact with the syntax of Python.
Do you want <code>len</code> to be callable on your objects? Implement <code>__len__</code>.
Do you want your objects to be iterables? Implement <code>__iter__</code>.
Do you want arithmetics to work on your objects? Implement <code>__add__</code> (and a bunch of others!).
Just to name a few things your objects could be doing.</p><p>In this training, we will go over a series of small use cases for many of the existing dunder methods: we will learn about the way in which each dunder method is supposed to work and then we implement it.
This will make you a more well-rounded Python developer because you will have a greater appreciation for how things work in Python.
I will also show you the approaches I follow when I am learning about a new dunder method and trying to understand how it works, which will help you explore the remainder dunder methods by yourself.</p><p>For this training, you need Python 3.8+ and your code editor of choice.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/mathspp/talks">Get the slides, exercises, and other resources on Github</a>.</p><p><span class="tag">Tutorial</span><span class="tag">(c)Python Internals</span></p></div><div class="session-card"><h2 class="highlighted"><a href="/session/how-to-setup-your-development-workflow-to-keep-your-code-clean">How to setup your development workflow to keep your code clean</a></h2><p class="session-card__author">Guillaume Dequenne</p><p>Clean code is something every developer should aim for, but how to make sure code is actually clean?

Done right, they bridge the gap between those analyzing the data and those consuming the analysis. However, learning to create impactful, aesthetically-pleasing visualizations can often be challenging. This session will equip you with the skills to make customized visualizations for your data using Python.</p><p>While there are many plotting libraries to choose from, the prolific Matplotlib library is always a great place to start. Since various Python data science libraries utilize Matplotlib under the hood, familiarity with Matplotlib itself gives you the flexibility to fine tune the resulting visualizations (e.g., add annotations, animate, etc.). This session will also introduce interactive visualizations using HoloViz, which provides a higher-level plotting API capable of using Matplotlib and Bokeh (a Python library for generating interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations) under the hood.</p><p><span class="tag">Tutorial</span><span class="tag">PyData: Software Packages &amp; Jupyter</span></p></div><div class="session-card"><h2 class="highlighted"><a href="/session/norvig-s-lispy-beautiful-and-illuminating-python-code">Norvig&#x27;s lispy: beautiful and illuminating Python code</a></h2><p class="session-card__author">Luciano Ramalho</p><p>Why isn&#x27;t <code>if</code> a function?

Math is everywhere and around us. It is in nature, music, sports, economics, engineering, and so on.  In our daily life, we use mathematics knowingly and unknowingly.  Many of us are unaware that forensic experts use mathematics to solve crime mysteries. In this workshop, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional detective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics and Python programming language to solve crime mysteries. In short, the workshop begins with an introduction to forensic mathematics and covers basic principles thereby setting the stage. Then, we will solve simple crime puzzles using mathematics and simple python scripts. Finally, we will solve a few complex hypothetical crime mysteries using advanced python concepts. The participants will learn how to use the concepts of mathematics such as statistics, probability, trigonometry, and graph theory, and python and its packages such as SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib to solve the crime puzzles.</p><p><span class="tag">Tutorial</span><span class="tag">Education, Teaching &amp; Further Training</span></p></div><div class="session-card"><h2 class="highlighted"><a href="/session/bulletproof-python-property-based-testing-with-hypothesis">Bulletproof Python ‚Äì Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis</a></h2><p class="session-card__author">Michael Seifert</p><p>Property-based testing is a great benefit to the robustness and maintainability of your software.

Then this tutorial is for you!
Data validation is often neglected in the process of working on data science projects. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the importance of implementing data validation for data science in commercial, open-source, and even hobby projects. We will then dive into some of the open-source tools available for validating data in Python and learn how to use them so that edge cases will never break our models.
The open-source Python community will come to our help and we will explore wonderful packages such as Pydantic for defining data models, Pandera for complementing the use of Pandas, and Great Expectations for diving deep into the data.
This tutorial will benefit anyone working on data projects in Python who want to learn about data validation. Some Python programming experience and understanding of data science are required. The examples used and the context of the discussion is around data science, but the knowledge can be implemented in any Python oriented project.</p><p><span class="tag">Tutorial</span><span class="tag">PyData: Data Engineering</span></p></div></main><footer><nav><h6>Quicklinks</h6><ul><li class=""><a href="/thankyou">EuroPython 2022 Team</a></li><li class=""><a href="/cfp">CFP</a></li><li class=""><a href="/voting">Community Voting</a></li><li class=""><a href="/mentorship">Mentorship</a></li><li class=""><a href="/covid-info">Covid Info</a></li><li class=""><a href="/visa">Visa Information</a></li><li class=""><a href="/sponsor">Sponsor</a></li><li class=""><a href="/contacts">Contacts</a></li><li class=""><a href="/terms">Terms</a></li><li class=""><a href="https://www.europython-society.org/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></nav><article><div class="footer__logo"><img width="444" height="444" src="/img/europythonlogo.png"/></div><div><p>EuroPython Society (EPS)<br/>Ramnebacken 45<br/>424 38 Agnesberg<br/>Sweden</p><p><a href="https://blog.europython.eu">blog.europython.eu</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/europython">twitter.com/europython</a><br/><a href="https://linkedin.com/company/europython">linkedin.com/company/europython</a><br/><a href="https://github.com/europython">github.com/europython</a></p><div id="powered-by-vercel"><a href="https://vercel.com/?utm_source=europython-2022&amp;utm_campaign=oss"><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/31049/1618983297-powered-by-vercel.svg" alt="powered by vercel"/></a></div></div></article></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"sessions":[{"code":"3B9WHE","title":"Python objects under the hood","speakers":[{"code":"BLNV7P","name":"Rodrigo Gir√£o Serr√£o","biography":"Rodrigo has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming ‚Äì so that he could solve more problems.

We will be using Colab notebooks for most of the tutorial. You can also run the notebooks on your local machine, but if you do that you'll need to install git-lfs to download some of the models we use.\r\n\r\nMost practical machine learning these days is \"supervised learning\". In supervised learning, we show a model a collection of example inputs and outputs, and train it to give the right output for each input. For example, we might show it pictures of animals, combined with a \"label\" for each picture like \"cat\" or \"dog\", in order to train it to identify which animal is in each photo. Or we could show it samples of text from Twitter posts, and give the tweets \"labels\" like \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\", in order to train it to identify unwanted tweets and filter them out automatically. In effect, the model learns to predict the correct \"label\" for any input that it sees.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule in supervised learning is that the more data you have, the better the model you can train. More data means more accuracy, whether the task is recognizing animals in images, or classifying text, or even driving a self-driving car. This is a real problem, though, when data collection isn't free; without a huge dataset of inputs and labels, it might be hard or impossible to train a model that's accurate enough for what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nProbably the single biggest revolution in machine learning in the last 5 years, particularly in NLP (natural language processing), has been the arrival of \"foundation models\", huge models trained for very long periods on vast amounts of text data. These models offer a solution to the problem of limited training data - by bringing a huge amount of linguistic prior knowledge with them, they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to learn a new task. In 2016, training a model to classify toxic comments might have required millions (or even tens of millions!) of examples and labels in order to achieve acceptable accuracy, but in 2022, we can start with a foundation model that already \"knows\" a lot about language, and achieve the same accuracy with a tiny fraction of that, and in a much shorter time, too!\r\n\r\nFoundation models can be intimidating, though - they're often created by industrial or academic research labs and published in papers that can be very impenetrable for people without a strong research background. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to abstract away that complexity and load, train and use foundation models without needing a Ph.D, or even any prior experience in machine learning! By the end of this 3-hour session, you should have the knowledge and code samples you need to train a better machine learning model than someone at the cutting edge of the field in 2016 could have achieved even with an entire research team.\r\n\r\nIn this course, we will use HuggingFace Transformers combined with the TensorFlow machine learning library. We will also use some of the most popular data science libraries in Python like Numpy and Pandas when preparing our data. You don't have to be familiar with any of these before attending the tutorial, and I'll do my best to explain what we're doing with them as we go!

This session will equip you with the skills to make customized visualizations for your data using Python.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many plotting libraries to choose from, the prolific Matplotlib library is always a great place to start. Since various Python data science libraries utilize Matplotlib under the hood, familiarity with Matplotlib itself gives you the flexibility to fine tune the resulting visualizations (e.g., add annotations, animate, etc.). This session will also introduce interactive visualizations using HoloViz, which provides a higher-level plotting API capable of using Matplotlib and Bokeh (a Python library for generating interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations) under the hood.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Join @StefanieMolin for her #dataviz in #Python workshop, which covers static, animated, \u0026 interactive visualizations with  @matplotlib  +  @HoloViews .","description":"#### Section 1: Getting Started With Matplotlib\r\nWe will begin by familiarizing ourselves with Matplotlib. Moving beyond the default options, we will explore how to customize various aspects of our visualizations. By the end of this section, you will be able to generate plots using the Matplotlib API directly, as well as customize the plots that libraries like pandas and Seaborn create for you.\r\n\r\n#### Section 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations\r\nStatic visualizations are limited in how much information they can show. To move beyond these limitations, we can create animated and/or interactive visualizations. Animations make it possible for our visualizations to tell a story through movement of the plot components (e.g., bars, points, lines). Interactivity makes it possible to explore the data visually by hiding and displaying information based on user interest. In this section, we will focus on creating animated visualizations using Matplotlib before moving on to create interactive visualizations in the next section.\r\n\r\n#### Section 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration\r\nWhen exploring our data, interactive visualizations can provide the most value. Without having to create multiple iterations of the same plot, we can use mouse actions (e.g., click, hover, zoom, etc.) to explore different aspects and subsets of the data.

Does your software frequently break in unexpected ways despite your testing efforts? Don‚Äôt despair! Property-based testing could be your way out of that mess. Rather than working harder and writing more test code, property-based testing forces you to work smarter and test more code with fewer tests.\r\n\r\nTraditional tests are example-based. They require the developer to come up with arbitrary inputs and check a system‚Äôs behavior against explicit outputs. More often than not, developers only think of inputs that are handled correctly by their code, thus leaving bugs hidden. Property-based tests generate the inputs for you and in many cases they‚Äôre more likely to find invalid inputs than humans. The difficulty lies in formulating these test cases.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop you‚Äôll be comfortable with property-based testing using Hypothesis.
