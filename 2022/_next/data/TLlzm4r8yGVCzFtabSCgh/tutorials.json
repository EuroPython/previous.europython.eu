Unfortunately, many programmers still do not follow it, fearing that it will impose a further burden on the already difficult life of a developer.\r\n\r\nTDD is a methodology, something that can help you to create better code. But it is not going to solve all your problems. As with all methodologies you have to pay attention not to commit blindly to it.

We will be using Colab notebooks for most of the tutorial. You can also run the notebooks on your local machine, but if you do that you'll need to install git-lfs to download some of the models we use.\r\n\r\nMost practical machine learning these days is \"supervised learning\". In supervised learning, we show a model a collection of example inputs and outputs, and train it to give the right output for each input. For example, we might show it pictures of animals, combined with a \"label\" for each picture like \"cat\" or \"dog\", in order to train it to identify which animal is in each photo. Or we could show it samples of text from Twitter posts, and give the tweets \"labels\" like \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\", in order to train it to identify unwanted tweets and filter them out automatically. In effect, the model learns to predict the correct \"label\" for any input that it sees.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule in supervised learning is that the more data you have, the better the model you can train. More data means more accuracy, whether the task is recognizing animals in images, or classifying text, or even driving a self-driving car. This is a real problem, though, when data collection isn't free; without a huge dataset of inputs and labels, it might be hard or impossible to train a model that's accurate enough for what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nProbably the single biggest revolution in machine learning in the last 5 years, particularly in NLP (natural language processing), has been the arrival of \"foundation models\", huge models trained for very long periods on vast amounts of text data. These models offer a solution to the problem of limited training data - by bringing a huge amount of linguistic prior knowledge with them, they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to learn a new task. In 2016, training a model to classify toxic comments might have required millions (or even tens of millions!) of examples and labels in order to achieve acceptable accuracy, but in 2022, we can start with a foundation model that already \"knows\" a lot about language, and achieve the same accuracy with a tiny fraction of that, and in a much shorter time, too!\r\n\r\nFoundation models can be intimidating, though - they're often created by industrial or academic research labs and published in papers that can be very impenetrable for people without a strong research background. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to abstract away that complexity and load, train and use foundation models without needing a Ph.D, or even any prior experience in machine learning! By the end of this 3-hour session, you should have the knowledge and code samples you need to train a better machine learning model than someone at the cutting edge of the field in 2016 could have achieved even with an entire research team.\r\n\r\nIn this course, we will use HuggingFace Transformers combined with the TensorFlow machine learning library. We will also use some of the most popular data science libraries in Python like Numpy and Pandas when preparing our data. You don't have to be familiar with any of these before attending the tutorial, and I'll do my best to explain what we're doing with them as we go! I don't assume any specific background in machine learning, and we won't need any advanced mathematics.

Moving beyond the default options, we will explore how to customize various aspects of our visualizations. By the end of this section, you will be able to generate plots using the Matplotlib API directly, as well as customize the plots that libraries like pandas and Seaborn create for you.\r\n\r\n#### Section 2: Moving Beyond Static Visualizations\r\nStatic visualizations are limited in how much information they can show. To move beyond these limitations, we can create animated and/or interactive visualizations. Animations make it possible for our visualizations to tell a story through movement of the plot components (e.g., bars, points, lines). Interactivity makes it possible to explore the data visually by hiding and displaying information based on user interest. In this section, we will focus on creating animated visualizations using Matplotlib before moving on to create interactive visualizations in the next section.\r\n\r\n#### Section 3: Building Interactive Visualizations for Data Exploration\r\nWhen exploring our data, interactive visualizations can provide the most value. Without having to create multiple iterations of the same plot, we can use mouse actions (e.g., click, hover, zoom, etc.) to explore different aspects and subsets of the data. In this section, we will learn how to use a few of the libraries in the HoloViz ecosystem to create interactive visualizations for exploring our data utilizing the Bokeh backend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n####  Prerequisites\r\nThis workshop is for anyone with basic knowledge of Python and an interest in learning how to take their data visualization skills to the next level.

Does your software frequently break in unexpected ways despite your testing efforts? Don’t despair! Property-based testing could be your way out of that mess. Rather than working harder and writing more test code, property-based testing forces you to work smarter and test more code with fewer tests.\r\n\r\nTraditional tests are example-based. They require the developer to come up with arbitrary inputs and check a system’s behavior against explicit outputs. More often than not, developers only think of inputs that are handled correctly by their code, thus leaving bugs hidden. Property-based tests generate the inputs for you and in many cases they’re more likely to find invalid inputs than humans. The difficulty lies in formulating these test cases.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop you’ll be comfortable with property-based testing using Hypothesis. You’ll have experience requesting appropriate test data from Hypothesis and in writing tests for common and more advanced properties. At work, your co-workers will be impressed by your unbreakable code ;)\r\n\r\nParticipants are expected to have basic familiarity with unit testing and a testing framework.
