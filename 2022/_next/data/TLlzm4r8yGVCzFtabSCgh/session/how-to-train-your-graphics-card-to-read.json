We will be using Colab notebooks for most of the tutorial. You can also run the notebooks on your local machine, but if you do that you'll need to install git-lfs to download some of the models we use.\r\n\r\nMost practical machine learning these days is \"supervised learning\". In supervised learning, we show a model a collection of example inputs and outputs, and train it to give the right output for each input. For example, we might show it pictures of animals, combined with a \"label\" for each picture like \"cat\" or \"dog\", in order to train it to identify which animal is in each photo. Or we could show it samples of text from Twitter posts, and give the tweets \"labels\" like \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\", in order to train it to identify unwanted tweets and filter them out automatically. In effect, the model learns to predict the correct \"label\" for any input that it sees.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule in supervised learning is that the more data you have, the better the model you can train. More data means more accuracy, whether the task is recognizing animals in images, or classifying text, or even driving a self-driving car. This is a real problem, though, when data collection isn't free; without a huge dataset of inputs and labels, it might be hard or impossible to train a model that's accurate enough for what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nProbably the single biggest revolution in machine learning in the last 5 years, particularly in NLP (natural language processing), has been the arrival of \"foundation models\", huge models trained for very long periods on vast amounts of text data. These models offer a solution to the problem of limited training data - by bringing a huge amount of linguistic prior knowledge with them, they greatly reduce the amount of data needed to learn a new task. In 2016, training a model to classify toxic comments might have required millions (or even tens of millions!) of examples and labels in order to achieve acceptable accuracy, but in 2022, we can start with a foundation model that already \"knows\" a lot about language, and achieve the same accuracy with a tiny fraction of that, and in a much shorter time, too!\r\n\r\nFoundation models can be intimidating, though - they're often created by industrial or academic research labs and published in papers that can be very impenetrable for people without a strong research background. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to abstract away that complexity and load, train and use foundation models without needing a Ph.D, or even any prior experience in machine learning!

Unfortunately, many programmers still do not follow it, fearing that it will impose a further burden on the already difficult life of a developer.\r\n\r\nTDD is a methodology, something that can help you to create better code. But it is not going to solve all your problems. As with all methodologies you have to pay attention not to commit blindly to it. Try to understand the reasons why certain practices are suggested by the methodology and you will also understand when and why you can or have to be flexible.\r\n\r\nDuring the workshop we will learn what TDD is, and what are the main rules. We will do this developing a very simple Python library together in a sort of a game that mirrors a daily TDD development routine.

We'll also take time to see how to configure Strawberry with Django.\r\n- Let's test our API\r\n\t- I'm a big fan of TDD, so before continuing with our workshop we'll quickly see how to test our GraphQL API using pytest.\r\n- Schema design\r\n\t- In this section we'll spend time taking a look at how to design a GraphQL schema. We'll also understand the difference between queries and mutations.\r\n- Authentication\r\n\t- In this section we'll implement authentication to our GraphQL API. We'll discuss session based auth vs JWT authentication.\r\n- Performance / Monitoring / Observability\r\n\t- In this section we'll discuss how we can add observability/monitoring to our APIs and make sure we can keep our API performant over time.\r\n\t- We'll also see how we can use dataloaders to make our queries efficient. We'll also talk about other potential performance improvements (SQL optimisation, Static Queries and more)\r\n- **Bonus**\r\n\t- Integration with React\r\n\t\t- In this section we'll see how we can use GraphQL with a frontend framework like React.\r\n\t- Subscriptions\r\n\t\t- In this section we'll see what subscriptions are in GraphQL and how you can leverage them to build realtime APIs.","duration":"180","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Wicklow Hall 1","start":"2022-07-11T13:45:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-11T15:15:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["BRSSQK","CXADJQ"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":null,"website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/build-a-production-ready-graphql-api-using-python"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
