Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it’s often difficult to know where to start or what you’re missing.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will show you around the CPython source code by implementing a new operator, a pipe operator. While doing so, I will discuss core parts of the internals, such as Python’s grammar, its syntax trees, and the underlying logic that will perform the operation. By the end, you will have a good idea of the moving parts involved in core language features.\r\n\r\nI will also take you through the steps necessary to make it all work. I’ll show you how I obtained a copy of the source code, regenerated the parser and token files, and how I compiled my modified version of CPython. I will also write and run tests to help me implement my changes. This should give you a mental framework that helps you while diving into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent [Python Developer’s Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).\r\n\r\nMy talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython’s internals. You don’t have to be an expert in Python, although some affinity with Python helps with understanding the internals.

It sometimes causes data scientists great headaches. But from a consumer and Pythonista point of view this can also be interesting data for exploration. It is very useful for building personalization technology, in particular recommender systems. And there are almost endless ways to use Python for it.\r\nSo, let’s request and use our own data to build a playlist recommender system which infers our music taste from our streaming history and uses it to retrieve songs from our favorites in a new way. We will call it “Your Rediscover Past”, a personalized playlist based on your streaming history and saved songs.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"In my talk, we explore our usage data requested according to GDPR and leverage it - together with Spotify’s Web API - to build a personalized playlist recommender system with Python.","description":"Personalized Playlist Recommendations on Spotify are great – some of them let us discover new songs, some others help us to rediscover songs. However, rediscovery seems to be limited on the more recent past, i.e. going only a month backwards. This is a problem if you like to rediscover some of your favorite songs you might have listened to a longer while ago. Sometimes we add them to our \"liked songs\" where they likely fade away. However, you once explicitly declared those tracks as favorites. So, what is it that we can do about this missing piece in personalized playlist recommendations?\r\n\r\nWell, the first thing we do is to request our personal usage data from Spotify according to GDPR. Second, we analyze and enrich it with track audio features offered by Spotify’s rich Web API. We derive the music taste profile of ourselves from 12 months of streaming history and use this taste profile to retrieve favorite songs we haven’t listened to for more than a year.
