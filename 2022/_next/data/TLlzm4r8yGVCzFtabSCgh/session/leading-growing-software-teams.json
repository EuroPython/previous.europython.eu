To do that we created extendable Python-based framework that allowed us to easily plug-in different Machine Translation engines and compare them across large variety of test datasets with a unified set of quality metrics. Our goal from the start was to create universal MT evaluation framework, that will be useful not only for healthcare domain, but to a wider community as well.\r\n\r\nAt this talk we will present our evaluation framework an will do a walk-through of its capabilities. We also cover how it can be extended to new MT engines, new test datasets and new language pairs. We will also present our evaluation results for several state-of-the-art machine translation engines, both open-source and cloud-based.\r\n\r\nAll the source code of our framework is published to open source:\r\nhttps://github.com/Optum/nmt","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Python-based universal evalaution framework for Machine Translation engines","description":"Task of Machine Translation engine evaluation may be very challenging. Quality of Machine Translation varies greatly depending on domain and language pair. Different MT engines may have different interfaces or APIs and different requirements to run. To add to that, even definition of a good translation may be debatable, with any automatic MT quality metric providing only approximation of actual translation quality. That's why having universal evaluation framework for this task is very important. In our work we tried to create such framework.\r\n\r\n1) We defined base translation class that unified all file handling, batch creation and result processing. As a result of that, only work needed to support new MT engine was creation of small child class that implemented couple of simple functions. That allows us to easily extend our framework to MT engines and new language pairs.\r\n\r\n2) We defined set of test datasets and provided a way to add new datasets to this set. For our evaluation our aim was to create test data that covers both general and healthcare domains  EMEA dataset (https://opus.nlpl.eu/EMEA.php), OPUS-100 (https://opus.nlpl.eu/opus-100.php), Paracrawl (https://paracrawl.eu/) and several others. But our data preparations scripts can be easily extended to other domains and datasets as well.\r\n\r\n3) We defined a set of quality metrics to evaluate results of MT engines. Metrics that we used included BLEU (https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu), BERTScore (https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score), ROUGE (https://github.com/pltrdy/rouge), TER and CHRF (both also from sacrebleu implementation).\r\n\r\nBeside MT evaluation framework we will present our own evaluation results. For our evaluation we used cloud based engines - Azure Translator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/), Google Translate (https://cloud.google.com/translate/), as well as open-source engines - Marian MT (https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/marian.html), NVIDIA's NeMo (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/machine_translation.html), Facebook's MBart 50 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50-one-to-many-mmt), Facebook's M2M100 (https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_418M). For open source engines we tried to use Huggingface's transformer implementation whenever possible. But as we mentioned our framework was designed in a way to be easily extendable to other MT engines and underlying frameworks.\r\n\r\nWe also will present evaluation results for NeMo and MarianMT engines that we fine-tuned specifically for healthcare domain. While these particular results may rather specific to our use case, they help to highlight how our framework can be extended to custom MT engines as well.","duration":"30","python_level":"some","domain_level":"some","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey Hall 1","start":"2022-07-15T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T12:25:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["GFGSGN","LLC3KD","MBJUKF","MMWYWZ","PQADBJ","TE7K7D"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"S78FW7","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/machine-translation-engines-evaluation-framework"},{"code":"LLC3KD","title":"Game Development with CircuitPython","speakers":[{"code":"CSLXTY","name":"Radomir Dopieralski","biography":"A Python programmer by day, an electronics hobbyist by night.

A single successful compromise of the content distribution infrastructure can affect millions of users, voluntarily installing the infected packages.\r\n\r\n[PEP 458](https://peps.python.org/pep-0458/) was designed to protect PyPI against a variety of possible attacks on PyPIs own content distribution network and PyPI mirrors, while giving administrators a mechanism to recover from a compromise if it happens. In addition, PEP 458 is a fundamental stepping stone for more advanced protection described in [PEP 480](https://peps.python.org/pep-0480/).\r\n\r\nBoth PEP 458 and 480 implement a specification called [\"The Update Framework\" (TUF)](http://theupdateframework.io/), which introduces a series of roles, keys and metadata formats that are published along with the packages they protect, and can be verified by a client software such as pip.\r\n\r\nOver the past couple of months we have made an effort to integrate the latest version of the Python TUF reference implementation with PyPI/Warehouse (see [draft PR](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/10870)).\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will give an introduction to PEP 458 and TUF, how it works and what it is good for.

Beynon, Alun Owens, Andrew J. Logsdail\r\nCardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales.\r\n\r\nComputational methods afford an insight into the behaviours and properties of materials and recently Python packages have increasingly become a powerful tool for the study of chemical systems. Computational chemistry is the branch of chemistry that studies chemical systems through simulation and involves HPC architecture and software packages. In general, there are two categories of simulation, dynamic and static and of these types, atoms in the system may be described by varying levels of theory: molecular (classical) mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM) or a combination of the two (QM/MM). Static calculations obtain the property of the system at a fixed geometry, whereas dynamic calculations study the evolution of a system over a given timeframe. \r\n\r\nPython has become an integral part of computational modelling of materials in recent years, with development of packages such as the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) [1], which is a set of modules for manipulating, running and visualising atomic simulation. Furthermore, ASE integrates seamlessly with many electronic structure software packages, used for calculating the energy and properties of systems based on some level of theory, e.g Density Functional Theory (DFT), such as FHI-aims and VASP. [2,3] Moreover, the combination with other Python packages that integrate with ASE provide an ecosystem for atomic simulations (figure 1). Packages such as CatLearn, [4] a machine-learning approach used for determining transition states and energies needed for reactions, along with Phonopy and FHI-vibes, [5,6] both are for studying lattice dynamics of materials, and Py-ChemShell,[7] used for QM/MM calculations, to name a few, provide a comprehensive toolkit for the computational study of materials and chemical systems. \r\n\r\nIn our research, such approaches as outlined above are essential to further our understanding of materials and chemical processes, and of particular interest are materials for green and sustainable processes such as catalysts used for biofuel production, and battery materials, namely, zeolite Tin-BETA and Prussian Blue, [8-10] respectively. In collaboration with experimentalists, we seek to understand the synthetic methods and properties of these materials, with the aim to further establish them as viable alternatives to fossil fuels. In this regard, as Python software becomes increasingly popular for the simulation and study of materials, it also provides the tools and methods needed for tackling some of the grand challenges of today. \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n[1] A.

Luckily and unluckily, those giants spoke paper-English and documented their achievements kind of publicly so we could advance the science. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will dissect the structure of a paper, looking for the essential points that will help us understand it and implement it. Following we will get our hands dirty and implement the paper using Python. \r\nIn particular, we will dive into the seminal paper \"Attention is all you need\" and implement a transformer using JAX.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaways from this talk are:\r\n - Demystify academic reading.\r\n - Understand the Transformer architecture.\r\n - An introduction to the JAX ecosystem.","abstract_as_a_tweet":"Understand and implement a transformer in JAX.

We should start once again discussing how applications are structured, how components are connected and how to lower coupling between different parts of a system, to avoid creating software that cannot easily be maintained or changed. The \"clean architecture\" model predates Robert Martin, who recently brought it back to the attention of the community, and is a way of structuring applications that leverages layers separation and internal APIs to achieve a very tidy, fully-tested, and loosely coupled system.\r\n\r\nThe talk introduces the main ideas of the architecture, showing how the layers can be implemented in Python, following the content of the book \"Clean Architectures in Python\" edited by Leanpub. The book recently reached 25,000 downloads and many readers found it useful to start learning how to test software and how to structure an application without relying entirely on the framework.","duration":"45","python_level":"some","domain_level":"none","delivery":"in-person","room":"Liffey A","start":"2022-07-15T11:55:00+01:00","end":"2022-07-15T12:40:00+01:00","talks_in_parallel":["GFGSGN","HE98XH","LLC3KD","MBJUKF","MMWYWZ","PQADBJ"],"talks_after":[],"next_talk_code":null,"prev_talk_code":"87XUMG","website_url":"https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/clean-architectures-in-python"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
