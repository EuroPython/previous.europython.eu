In such cases, maintaining consistency across a project helps everyone involved. One aspect of this is ensuring that there are (at least partial) automated tests to enforce this style.\r\n\r\nThis training aims to enable the audience to write such tests by giving them a tour of code analysis and the vast array of tools it makes available to us. First, we dissect the code using Python's `ast` and `tokenize` modules and object internals like `__dict__`. From there and on, we visit some real-world examples:\r\n- A test to detect unnecessary use of double-quotes. They are such a terrible waste of pixels, after all.\r\n- Flagging the use of list() instead of []. The former is slower â€“ as it requires an extra lookup in \"globals\" â€“ and might result in a bug if the name is rebound to another object.\r\n- Find if statements are nested for more than four levels. It can lead to hard-to-understand, ugly-looking code.\r\n- Look for unused imports.

Does your software frequently break in unexpected ways despite your testing efforts? Donâ€™t despair! Property-based testing could be your way out of that mess. Rather than working harder and writing more test code, property-based testing forces you to work smarter and test more code with fewer tests.\r\n\r\nTraditional tests are example-based. They require the developer to come up with arbitrary inputs and check a systemâ€™s behavior against explicit outputs. More often than not, developers only think of inputs that are handled correctly by their code, thus leaving bugs hidden. Property-based tests generate the inputs for you and in many cases theyâ€™re more likely to find invalid inputs than humans. The difficulty lies in formulating these test cases.\r\n\r\nAfter this workshop youâ€™ll be comfortable with property-based testing using Hypothesis. Youâ€™ll have experience requesting appropriate test data from Hypothesis and in writing tests for common and more advanced properties. At work, your co-workers will be impressed by your unbreakable code ;)\r\n\r\nParticipants are expected to have basic familiarity with unit testing and a testing framework.
