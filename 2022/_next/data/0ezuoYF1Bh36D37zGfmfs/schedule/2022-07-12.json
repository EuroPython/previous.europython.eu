In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the importance of implementing data validation for data science in commercial, open-source, and even hobby projects. We will then dive into some of the open-source tools available for validating data in Python and learn how to use them so that edge cases will never break our models.\r\nThe open-source Python community will come to our help and we will explore wonderful packages such as Pydantic for defining data models, Pandera for complementing the use of Pandas, and Great Expectations for diving deep into the data.\r\nThis tutorial will benefit anyone working on data projects in Python who want to learn about data validation. Some Python programming experience and understanding of data science are required. The examples used and the context of the discussion is around data science, but the knowledge can be implemented in any Python oriented project.","day":"2022-07-12","time":930,"endTime":1020,"audience":"intermediate","rooms":["Wicklow Hall 2A"],"slug":"data-validation-for-data-science","type":"","speakers":[{"code":"3Y9QDE","name":"Natan Mish","biography":"Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Zimmer Biomet - the world's leading Orthopaedic medical devices company.
